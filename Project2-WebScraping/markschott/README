The bitcoin folder contains the NLP analysis that done with the syuzhet package as well as some data exploration in Juptyer notebooks. There is a basic
FFT, as well as a notebook that does linear regression on specific time frames following news events. 

The commodities and currencies folder contains the time series portion of the analysis. There are some custom python functions which I wrote to plot various subplots and do some basic calculations.
    1. QQRR.py 	creates the quantile-quantile plot for the daily return rate
    2. drr_autocorrelation.py creates the autocorrelation plots.
    3. bitcoin_lagged.py creates multiple return rates at various lagged times.
    4. EDA_all.py and EDA_commodities_and_currencies.py read-in some data, and		does some EDA, and visualization on these datasets.
