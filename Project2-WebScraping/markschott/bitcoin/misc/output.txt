      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>
While the early states were heavily republican and thus a given for Trump - where he was just projected winner -&nbsp; moments ago votes have begun comiking in from key battleground states including Florida (29 electoral votes) and Virginia (13). As well as Georgia (16), South Carolina (9) and Vermont (3), which was just called for Hillary.
As of this moment Trump has won 19 electoral votes, while Hillary has 3.
With 12% of the vote in, Trump has a modest lead in Florida, and a bigger lead in Georgia.

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>

As well as Georgia (16), South Carolina (9) and Vermont (3), which was just called for Hillary.

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Without the imported voting base of the Democreeps this race wouldn't even be competitive at all, Trump would easily win by a landslide. <a href="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" title="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/</a>

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;

My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!

      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>

While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>
While the early states were heavily republican and thus a given for Trump - where he was just projected winner -&nbsp; moments ago votes have begun comiking in from key battleground states including Florida (29 electoral votes) and Virginia (13). As well as Georgia (16), South Carolina (9) and Vermont (3), which was just called for Hillary.
As of this moment Trump has won 19 electoral votes, while Hillary has 3.
With 12% of the vote in, Trump has a modest lead in Florida, and a bigger lead in Georgia.

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

Drain the swamp? They are gonna burn it down.
      Without the imported voting base of the Democreeps this race wouldn't even be competitive at all, Trump would easily win by a landslide. <a href="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" title="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/</a>

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!

      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>

While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:04pm</strong></em>
While the early states were heavily republican and thus a given for Trump - where he was just projected winner -&nbsp; moments ago votes have begun comiking in from key battleground states including Florida (29 electoral votes) and Virginia (13). As well as Georgia (16), South Carolina (9) and Vermont (3), which was just called for Hillary.
As of this moment Trump has won 19 electoral votes, while Hillary has 3.
With 12% of the vote in, Trump has a modest lead in Florida, and a bigger lead in Georgia.

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

<em><strong>Update 7:00pm.</strong></em>
And following Trump, commanding lead in the first states, CNN just called Indiana and Kentucky for Donald Trump; while Hillary clinton projected to win Vermont.
While it is still very early in the evening, with only a handful of the early votes counted, the first results are coming in and Trump - at least for now - has the lead in both republican strongholds of Kentucky and Indiana with some 70% of the vote, in line with expectations.
Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

Drain the swamp? They are gonna burn it down.
      Without the imported voting base of the Democreeps this race wouldn't even be competitive at all, Trump would easily win by a landslide. <a href="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" title="http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthjustice.net/politics/mapping-the-rising-tide/</a>

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.

Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Glad to be of help.
      The FUCK YOU heard round the world!
Congratulations to President Elect Donald J. Trump!
      Congratulations Americans! Good to see you ain't THAT stupid.
      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

Trump&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">early lead </a>is thanks to Kentucky and Indiana.

My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!

      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.

  <div class="content">This chart tells the whole story of the night: Trump - the massive underdog - appears to have pulled off precisely what he promised to do: Brexit times 10, having won virtually every key battleground state including Ohio, North Carolina and moments ago, Florida.

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake

      Oh YEAH!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      Let it crash. &nbsp;Let the tribe finally start to raise interest rates in an effort to blame the second Great Depression on Trump. &nbsp;Word will get out to the suffering masses WHO did all of this. &nbsp;Maybe THEN a serious discussion will begin on the very essence of our money and who issues it. &nbsp;THAT is the key to everything.
      &nbsp;
&nbsp;
My *guess* is that the Fed (and other D-Teamers) will try to screw Trump: crash the markets with the eye on causing a recession.
Recall that<strong> Reagan </strong>had a recession at the beginning, yet succeeded greatly later.

      Ding Dong, the witch is dead. &nbsp;Finally. &nbsp;
Suck it Hillary, you piece of shit. &nbsp;I don't even care if you see jailtime (that would be a bonus). &nbsp;You, your pedophile husband and your network of high end, elite political donors just lost BIGTIME. &nbsp;You don't get another shot at it in 2020 because you will be too frail to try again even if you survive what's heading your way. &nbsp;
THE CLINTON DYNASTY IS DEAD. &nbsp;And we're the better for it.
All those "friends" of yours you estorted money from on the promise you would be the next president? &nbsp;Yeah, they'll be wanting that money back now. &nbsp;Good luck explaining this to them, you fucking bitch. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll just put a bullet in you and save us the cost of the trial.
&nbsp;
      good thoughts, many of them, but imo we so need a trial, a fair one with real investigation, of the clintons and nearly everything and everyone they touched. &nbsp;i await further confirmation for further plans.
      Pssst?  Mr Comey?  If you pop down to the Clinton Foundation at 9am with, say, 100 officers (and SWAT for effect) you may find a situation something like this.

      Are Goldman Sachs going to demand their money back?
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! HAHAHAHAhahahahahaha
      Nodebt, all of what you said and then some. The entirety of the MSM threw their weight and what was left of their credibility behind her for the past year and a half and have nothing to show for it.
&nbsp;
She was able to cheat and steal her way through the primaries, but couldn't overcome trump. Pretty god damn funny. Even with the DNC establishment, wall street, corporate donors, and half the republican party behind her, they still couldn't roll her corpse across the finish line. After the swamp is drained, he needs to go in there with a flame thrower.
      &nbsp;
... here I am projecting a Trump win and a Clintonite retard downvotes it ... I love it&nbsp; ... :D&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;
      <strong>It's going to be a long night. &nbsp;Trump and his campaign advisors will put a big pot of coffee to brew. &nbsp;While Hillary and her advisors, more specifically John Podesta, will be drinking Bill's semen mixed with human blood and breast milk. Hillary and her gang will be doing quite a bit of spirit cooking tonight.</strong>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
      The Wall Street hebrews must be crying about all that cash they gave Hitlary. &nbsp;They'll be nickel and diming everyone to make up all the loot they gambled on Hitlary. &nbsp;Allthose wasted SHECKLES!
      I just told my son, who is up WAY past his bedtime, that Trump is probably going to win. &nbsp;He wanted Trump but was facing a lot of Hillary supporters in his class at school. &nbsp;He couldn't understand why they would want her over Trump. &nbsp;And, trust me, his raw, heart-felt reasons for supporting Trump bear NO resemblance to my cynical, limited-scope reasons.&nbsp;
If I could describe the look on his face, your heart would melt. &nbsp;Little dude just gave me a fist-bump on his way to bed. &nbsp;He NEVER gives me a fist-bump.
G'night all.
&nbsp;
      My favorite part? Watching the MSM taking their schlonging. Megan over at Fox is has blood coming out of who knows where. Wolf B. is about to go down on himself for relief. I also seriously thought Bob Schiefer was going to start crying while telling us Hillary could still win.
      I have cynical, limited scope reasons as well. I don't forsee a draining of the swamp, I think its beyond any one person's ability to do, especially when he will have both houses of congress looking to protect their donors and an entrenched deep state establishment. Not that I wouldn't like him to succeed and then some. I just don't want to see a war with russia over syria, etc. These people, if left in charge, are going to get us all killed.
&nbsp;
That, plus his enemies list is like a who's who of people I despise. I hold no hope for MAGA or any of that other stuff. I just hope he goes in and upset the apple cart a little bit before he gets JFKd and pence takes us back to neocon business as usual.
      Drink bleach libtards.
      You mean drink bleachbit.
      Drink bleach libtards.

      Possibly the only time I've ever smiled as the NASDAQ and similar markets went limit down.&nbsp; Trump 2016......&nbsp;
      Trump must actually be winning 70/30 to pull this off.
It's too difficult to steal a landslide...
      Exactly.  Maybe75%.  It's kind of scary because if they are allowing this they may pull the plug on the economy.  That's okay though because it needs to happen anyway. 
      Oh ye of fucking little faith......
&nbsp;
I am on record at 325 EVs for Trump.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't underperform here.
&nbsp;
PA come to Papa.......
      Oh stop it for fuckssake
