title,review
"Great phone! Still working through all of the new options.","I am very pleased with my new Samsung 7. My Samsung 4 was still working , but the charging port was damaged so I had no option but purchase another phone. At this point, I am very satisified with all of the options, but still learning. I will be returning to the nearby Verizon store to get help figuring out several adjust to.items but overall, the phone is fairly easy to"
"Superior phone","The phone is all the quality you would need in a smart phone. With the new software update there really no flaws to this phone. It has excellent resolution ,speed, multitasking functions, withstands the environment, outstanding battery life, and the way it is built is superior to the touch of your hand."
"Mary's New Phone","Like the Auto application that I can use on my Ford Focus. Appreciate the long battery life. Like the larger size."
"Takes Great Pictures","I take a lot of photography with a Nikon, and I found the pictures I took with this camera did not need any additional processing i.e. lightroom. I would recommend an sd card to store your photos so you don't have to fill up the memory in the phone"
"Great features","Fast response, decent speakers,great features Battery life could be better. Decent camera. Overall a great phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone."
"Great Features! I've had a Galaxy S2, S5 and now the S7. Wouldn't have anything but Samsung","So easy to learn to use. So many advancements since the Galaxy S2. Many features are a simple one-click."
"The same as my last phone!","Simple to use, great audio and I love it, just like my last one! I really with someone would design a battery that kept it's charge longer! How about solar powered??"
"Good looking phone","I like the fact that it charges very quickly. I chose the gold which I love. I wish it had more of a variety of ringtones to choose from."
"Easy transition from Galaxy 3.","Easy transition from Galaxy 3. Data transfer from old device to new device was smooth. New functionality not too difficult to master."
"Very nice phone, with excellent features.","I have not had this new phone for more than One week, And have not been disappointed so far. I like this phone much better than my old Galaxy-S4."
"Similar to my old s4 but is a lot faster!","The basic operation of the phone is enough like my old s4 that there was no learning curve. I updated to Android 7.0 a day after I got the phone which presented more of a challenge than the hardware. I haven't explored the new features of the camera yet but on the whole it is a better version of the s4 I have been using for 3 years. (Note to Samsung: put the on/off button on the top of the phone. It is too easy to hit it accidentally.) Also I miss the replaceable battery. Hope I don't have a really expensive brick with a 5 minute battery life in 18 months!"
"Screen is to small","Screen is to small. When coming from a note 5.But nice phone very happy with Samsung phones all together"
"Ms","I am having a bit of trouble finding my voicemail, but just started looking today lol Fantastic customer service and priducts"
"Added new phone","I like the phone it is what i expected i just feel the prices are to high,the service is great and the people at the stores are wonderful"
"Super easy to use","The Galaxy S7 meets my expectations in a phone. The apps are easily accessable. The speed is great. The phone is easy to handle and the camera works very well with nice clear pictures."
"Awesome","The phone is really awesome with cool apps. It is really thin and fits great in my pocket. The internet is really fast and it takes great pictures, even in the dark."
"Went from the S4 to the S7.","I was in no doubt in need of an update. My old phone was the S4, a week before the S5 came out all those years ago. I needed a new cellphone and decided to still stick with the Galaxy and merely got the S7. It's easy to transition to, it was simple to use, and I'm already use to the new features. The battery will easily last me throughout my day without me charging it, going from 8am in the morning until around 1am the next, still having around 20% left even after constant use."
"Slick and great features","'Just upgraded from a 3-year-old Android...such an improvement, especially the speed of the system and the camera. The battery was being used very quickly until the "performance mode" was changed, from "high performance" to "optimized" - thus saving battery power - so I'd recommend doing this unless you need, i.e., everything running on your device or things like having the brightest screen at all times. This phone can also be charged "wirelessly" with a wireless charger that you place the phone on - no connection needed! Have only had the phone 1 week but am happy so far. Only negative is the high cost of this device and lack of a 2-year contract, which used to keep the price down."
"Awesome phone","Awesome phone and I love Verizon never had any issues and customer service is awesome as well . The inventory they have on phones is great the overall of Verizon is awesome !!!"
"love it","Holds a charge well. Ease of apps and the clarity is great. Love the camera and my voice calls come in much clearer"
"Great phone! Really easy to get used to!","The S7 is so close to the S5 that I did have as far as the way the phone works. Made it easy to use!"
"Fabulous phone and great service @","I love my new Samsung S7. I had an S6 previously...Samsung continues to innovate. I'll upgrade to the S8 in time I'm sure. I like the water resistance, screen responsiveness, build quality, and performance."
"They did my transfer from my Galaxy S4 to my upgraded Galaxy S7 NO PROBLEM","I enjoy all the good features of the S7........I enjoy my Gear VR with my S7....My mom likes it my aunt and uncle like it"
"Feedback 2017","I'm loving the storage and the camera on the Galaxy S7. The phone is the perfect size and it has good accessories."
"Samsung S7 solid, well built, looks good.","The Samsung S7 is a very solid, well built, phone. It's all metal with solid switches. The max microSD cap is 200 GByte, which San Disk produces. The battery is not replaceable, so getting an ANKER 10000 mAHour external battery was a logical choice for me (this battery is cheap at Amazon). I cannot sort my music by date, cause unknown. I take the SAME microSD disc with the songs, and insert into the OLD Samsung S4 and sort by date works. I relocate the disc to the S7, and the sort by date doesn't work correctly. Phone or PlayerPro? Still, I love the phone. It's very fast."
"Fantastic Phone!","This is a great phone that does everything! It takes amazing pictures and with HD Voice and Video Calling, it's like talking with someone face to face. I optimized the display to preserve on battery, but the quality of the display is still awesome. Insert an SD card to greatly expand storage capacity. The only negative is syncing email, calendar, and contacts with Exchange is a battery drain. I had to sync my exchange work email through Gmail, which solved the battery drain problem."
"Happy with phone","Very happy with my S7. I had an S4 and I was able to transfer 90% of the information I had on my S4 with little to no trouble because of Cloud and direct transfer."
"Greatest phone ever.","Great phone. A lot better than my old phone. Many new features. I don't know how I ever lived without it. It is a vast improvement from my last phone. I'm sure I'll have many years of enjoyment using my new phone."

"Love it!","1st one had an issue with battery charging to 100%. Returned it the next day and this one works great. Love the camera! Love that the battery seems to last longer. Got this one on the recommendation of a friend and so glad I did!"
"Easy transition from my old phone","Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7. The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4. The only con that I have is the curved surface and slim design make it very hard to securely hold the phone. I definitely recommend getting a protective case for it."

"Upgrade to a new Samsug S7","The Galaxy 7 has proven to be an easy upgrade from my Samsug S5. The data transfer went well.

The battery gets quite hot at times of heave usage but neve to hot to hold my phone."

"My first "real" smartphone","I upgraded to the s7 after having the Core Prime for about a year and half. The transition couldn't have been any easier, and I am happy to have a great quality phone with plenty of room for the apps I need. I am planning to get a 128 gb memory card so that I can put all of my music, podcasts, and audiobooks on the phone too. The price was a bit daunting, but if this phone lasts 3 years, I can justify the price."
"It's good","I liked my old phone, a Droid Turbo 2 better from the start, but I hope this phone's battery will last more than 1 year. It's a good phone, I just really loved my motorola phones and the galaxy is a bit different."

Reasonable price with great promotion now! Fortunately, I'm satisfied with Galaxy S7. It has really fast speed, quick respond, nice compatibility and perfect quality of camera.

"Love this new phone!","I had had the S4 before getting a new phone, to say I needed and update is an understatement! One of my favorite features is definitely the wireless charging, even through my Otterbox case. Plus, when I called to activate it, customer service champ Eric reviewed my plan and updated me to the Verizon 5 gigs rollover data plan. The phone calls are crystal clear and the video quality is incredible (not a professional though, can't speak to that expertise). Loving it!"

"S7","I had a Droid Maxx before and liked it. It was my first smart phone. Had it for two years. I'm 60 years old. I like this new phone much more. Better camera, lots of storage, more features. I'm not super techie. But I do know my way around technology and I would recommend this phone."
"Excellent hardware","I prefer my phones not too large and not too small and the Galaxy S7 is a happy medium when it comes to screen size. The battery life and camera are both top notch. Internal storage seems average given other options on the market, but the memory is expandable via SD card."

I am still in awe and have shown all of my iPhone using friends how fast and easy this phone is. I'm hooked forever!!"

"My New Galaxy 7","My friends told me I would regret waiting so long to upgrade...now I know they were right. I love the phone...all aspects and features."
"Definitely worth the money","I've had the phone about 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy that I went with this phone. The colors are sharp. The battery lasts all day, even when traveling and using it. The Gold color is gorgeous! It was VERY simple to transfer all of my old phone to this one, even with switching carriers, I was extremely impressed with that part. I had considered the Edge, but went with this one because I can be a tad clumsy and I'm glad that I did because I've already dropped this one and not caused any damage to it. I have a simple case for it (because it matches the phone) and the InvisiGlass(?) front screen cover, but that's it. Overall, this is an awesome phone!"

"Best phone I have ever owned","Much brighter and clearer screen. Camera is a big step up to my old S5 phone news. Well worth price of the upgrade."
"Love this phone!","It has a bigger screen than the s6 edge. The screen quality is much better, more crisp. Pictures are wonderful! And I don't have to worry about accidentally spilling anything on it where it's waterproof! So far so good!!"
"My first smartphone.","Still learning how to use it, not sure I'll ever use it to it's full capacity. It seems intuitive, fairly easy to work through the process when using a new feature. As time goes it should become a more comfortable tool."
"New s7","Galaxy s7 has many good features. Ease of use is good. Photos are great. Takes time to learn all the things it can do and to set every up the way you want it. Worth the time."

"Great phone","The phone is a improvement from 6-'s Sam Sung. Battery life good. Fun phone. I like using camera for dj events."
"Fast easy and practical phone!","I upgraded from a really old galaxy s2 and I knew anything I got would be better. I'm glad Verizon has a new plan so my bill ended up the same with the new phone payments and insurance. Only thing I don't like is the sim and SD card loading tray."
"Was an easy transition from my old phone","I haven't had enough time yet to learn all the features. The features I have used were easy to transition from my old galazy 4"
"Samsung Galaxy S 7","I am impressed with the various facilities afforded by this phone. That includes the battery life and camera."
"Galaxy s7","So far, I love this phone. The battery life is so much better than the s5, which is what I had before."
"Easy to use","Easy to use, ease of transition from old phone since we were using a Samsung S4 and ungraded to a S7. The new software is extremely fast."
"Very pleased with function and form of GS7","Slightly smaller, which is actually a good thing, than the GS5 I had before. Fits in the pocket more smoothly. Operation-wise, it's fast to boot up, battery lasts a good long while, and it's generally an improvement on the older Galaxy models. Very pleased."
"Awesome phone","This phone does a lot of things, a bunch of things I probably don't even know about yet. Go s7!!!!!!"
"Love how easy it is to use.","It's got alot of fantastic features. Love the quality. Would love to learn more about what other features it offers.."
"Love Galaxy S7","This phone is a little smaller than the S5 & I am not a fan of the slight curve to the phone's edge, but every other feature is excellent. I thought my old phone took good pictures but this one is outstanding! The battery life is much better!"
"Great phone & easy to use !","This phone is easy to use and has some upgrades from my s6 like email functions, which are important since I am a manager and use my phone a lot for my job. I love it"
"Great additional internal storeage","I needed to replace my Galaxy S4, due to lots of redundant issues. I narrowed my choices to The S7, Google's Pixel and an I phone 7. I am so glad i made the choice i did. Everything is really good on the S7, especially the camera. I have problems holding my phone still due to shakiness. Even when I zoom in to 8x the picture is very steady."
"What's there not to like?!","I cannot put enough words to describe my love for the phone. To make it easier I'll list my only one complaint. Battery life...but beyond that, the phone is amazing!"
"Phone","Good live my new phone price was good fast on line pictures show well need to receive something free"
"Fabulous phone that is easy to use!","I would recommend Verizon. Great customer care, fair prices. Easy to work with. The two main things I look for as a customer are excellent customer care and affordable prices. Those are the two main qualities I look for when choosing to do business with any company and Verizon has them in abundance. Very proud to be a new Verizon customer."
"Faster and smoother than my beloved S5.","My new S7 is faster and smoother than my beloved S5. I ride my mobile devices into the ground and traded in my S5 only when it started heating up at inconvenient times, such as when my wife is trying to reach me. Anyway, I love the S7 so far. Using it is effortless."
"wonderful!!!","Everything I hoped it would be. The size of the phone,the weight and sound is great. I feel this phone is a great value."
"I love my phone","My phone does much more than you last android as well as look better, the screen itself was a hazard. But overall I am enjoying this product and look forward to the great customer service that I have not been receiving from my last service provider."
"S7","I love my phone ! Way better service then other companies in my area. Friendly staff and fast service"
"It is like my old phone (so easy to use)...but 100 times better","Every day, I find a new use for my phone. It was easy to transition to but it has so many added features. It helps me at school as a timer, I love the beautiful pictures that it takes, I love that it is so thin and the screen is larger...I Just Love It!!!!!!!"
"Samsung Galaxy s7","I enjoy this product a lot wish it was a little bigger and had it's own stylist. I enjoy that the phone is so smart."
"Nice Phone Samsung G7","Nice Phone....sleek and easy to use. Had no problem transferring data from old phone. I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family. It serves my needs"
"easy to use fast and snappy","very well built phone top of the line, fast and snappy, easy to navigate, like apps and the health app is awesome"
"Every Samsung Galaxy Gets Better!","The Samsung Galaxy 7 is my third Galaxy phone. I had the S3 and the S5. I was happy with all of them, but they improve with with each upgrade. I am happy with the 32 MB memory, as I had 16MB in the past. I do not like the non-removable battery. I hope this battery lasts. I like the time on the lock screen. And something as small as a small bump on the charging cord that lets me know which way is up when inserting it in the phone in the dark, is a plus for me. The fast charging is also a plus. There were no decisions to be be made. A Samsung 7 was going to be my next phone."
"Was an easy transition.","So far it has been easy to use, A little getting used to coming from the Samsung Convoy flip phone. But was fairly adept to is in just a couple of hours. If it holds up as well as the Convoy, then all should be good."
