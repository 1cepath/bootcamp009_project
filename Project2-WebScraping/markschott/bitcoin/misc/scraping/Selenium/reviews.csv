"I take a lot of photography with a Nikon, and I found the pictures I took with this camera did not need any additional processing i.e. lightroom. I would recommend an sd card to store your photos so you don't have to fill up the memory in the phone",kdscot1,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-18,Takes Great Pictures

So easy to learn to use. So many advancements since the Galaxy S2. Many features are a simple one-click.,SalVV,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-17,"Great Features! I've had a Galaxy S2, S5 and now the S7. Wouldn't have anything but Samsung"
"Simple to use, great audio and I love it, just like my last one! I really with someone would design a battery that kept it's charge longer! How about solar powered??",RARM,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-24,The same as my last phone!
I like the fact that it charges very quickly. I chose the gold which I love. I wish it had more of a variety of ringtones to choose from.,Ronnie17,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-19,Good looking phone
Easy transition from Galaxy 3. Data transfer from old device to new device was smooth. New functionality not too difficult to master.,Kwisman3,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-16,Easy transition from Galaxy 3.

The basic operation of the phone is enough like my old s4 that there was no learning curve. I updated to Android 7.0 a day after I got the phone which presented more of a challenge than the hardware. I haven't explored the new features of the camera yet but on the whole it is a better version of the s4 I have been using for 3 years. (Note to Samsung: put the on/off button on the top of the phone. It is too easy to hit it accidentally.) Also I miss the replaceable battery. Hope I don't have a really expensive brick with a 5 minute battery life in 18 months!,KGB409,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-16,Similar to my old s4 but is a lot faster!

"The phone is really awesome with cool apps. It is really thin and fits great in my pocket. The internet is really fast and it takes great pictures, even in the dark.",Talkingshermo,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-14,Awesome
"I was in no doubt in need of an update. My old phone was the S4, a week before the S5 came out all those years ago. I needed a new cellphone and decided to still stick with the Galaxy and merely got the S7. It's easy to transition to, it was simple to use, and I'm already use to the new features. The battery will easily last me throughout my day without me charging it, going from 8am in the morning until around 1am the next, still having around 20% left even after constant use.",SeroLeir,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-24,Went from the S4 to the S7.
"'Just upgraded from a 3-year-old Android...such an improvement, especially the speed of the system and the camera. The battery was being used very quickly until the ""performance mode"" was changed, from ""high performance"" to ""optimized"" - thus saving battery power - so I'd recommend doing this unless you need, i.e., everything running on your device or things like having the brightest screen at all times. This phone can also be charged ""wirelessly"" with a wireless charger that you place the phone on - no connection needed! Have only had the phone 1 week but am happy so far. Only negative is the high cost of this device and lack of a 2-year contract, which used to keep the price down.",JC 83,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-12,Slick and great features

I'm loving the storage and the camera on the Galaxy S7. The phone is the perfect size and it has good accessories.,SBrooks,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-12,Feedback 2017
"The Samsung S7 is a very solid, well built, phone. It's all metal with solid switches. The max microSD cap is 200 GByte, which San Disk produces. The battery is not replaceable, so getting an ANKER 10000 mAHour external battery was a logical choice for me (this battery is cheap at Amazon). I cannot sort my music by date, cause unknown. I take the SAME microSD disc with the songs, and insert into the OLD Samsung S4 and sort by date works. I relocate the disc to the S7, and the sort by date doesn't work correctly. Phone or PlayerPro? Still, I love the phone. It's very fast.",SamsSon,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-11,"Samsung S7 solid, well built, looks good."
"This is a great phone that does everything! It takes amazing pictures and with HD Voice and Video Calling, it's like talking with someone face to face. I optimized the display to preserve on battery, but the quality of the display is still awesome. Insert an SD card to greatly expand storage capacity. The only negative is syncing email, calendar, and contacts with Exchange is a battery drain. I had to sync my exchange work email through Gmail, which solved the battery drain problem.",BonnyS7,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-24,Fantastic Phone!
Very happy with my S7. I had an S4 and I was able to transfer 90% of the information I had on my S4 with little to no trouble because of Cloud and direct transfer.,Apachie14,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-11,Happy with phone

Coming form a Samsung Galaxy S4 it was an easy transition to the S7. The camera is exceptional and the other functions are easily used and similar to the S4. The only con that I have is the curved surface and slim design make it very hard to securely hold the phone. I definitely recommend getting a protective case for it.,Gmatt,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-06,Easy transition from my old phone

"I've had the phone about 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy that I went with this phone. The colors are sharp. The battery lasts all day, even when traveling and using it. The Gold color is gorgeous! It was VERY simple to transfer all of my old phone to this one, even with switching carriers, I was extremely impressed with that part. I had considered the Edge, but went with this one because I can be a tad clumsy and I'm glad that I did because I've already dropped this one and not caused any damage to it. I have a simple case for it (because it matches the phone) and the InvisiGlass(?) front screen cover, but that's it. Overall, this is an awesome phone!",MsSoftailDC,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-03-17,Definitely worth the money

"The Samsung Galaxy 7 is my third Galaxy phone. I had the S3 and the S5. I was happy with all of them, but they improve with with each upgrade. I am happy with the 32 MB memory, as I had 16MB in the past. I do not like the non-removable battery. I hope this battery lasts. I like the time on the lock screen. And something as small as a small bump on the charging cord that lets me know which way is up when inserting it in the phone in the dark, is a plus for me. The fast charging is also a plus. There were no decisions to be be made. A Samsung 7 was going to be my next phone.",LindaTea,Samsung Galaxy S7,2017-04-24,Every Samsung Galaxy Gets Better!
