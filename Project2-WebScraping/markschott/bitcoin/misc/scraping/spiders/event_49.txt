On February 13th, 2012, starting at about 4:30 Eastern Time (2:30 MST), the BTCUSD crashed, concurrently, Trade Hill  that it was closing it doors and returning all deposits. The images below are two, 24-hour, snapshots of the BTCUSD crash on February 13th and 14th. The red line in each chart is about the time Trade Hill announced it was closing its doors.Trade Hills termination and subsequent selloff of at least a portion of the bitcoins it controlled likely instigated the crash. Trade Hill did not disclose how it intended to return the funds deposited, however, Trade Hills niche was its ability to receive wire transfers from all major banks and currencies. Thus, for certain account Trade Hill may need to convert its bitcoin back tot he currencies it initially received. It is not clear how large Trade Hill was or how much capital Trade Hill controlled, however, due to the wide range of products and services it offered (e.g., bitcoin.com, bitinstant.com, etc.), its capital is likely substantial. If Trade Hill was executing massive sell orders in order to return money to its depositors accounts, then the recent crash of February 13th may beartificialinstigated, and then compounded with other market factors.The closing of Trade Hill may be a sign of what is to come. Trade Hill cited that its close was due to increasing regulation (a topic I enjoy writing on) and chargebacks. Chargebacks are the mechanism by which PayPal and other banks will reverse an order based on the buyers dissatisfaction of the received goods or services (in this case bitcoins). Chargebacks have been a major source of uncertainty for BTC traders, and will likely continue to be a problem. Many BTC exchanges and traders use Dwolla, because it claims to not issue chargebacks. Recently, however, Trade Hill  that even Dwolla will issue chargebacks in certain circumstances. If users are unable to due to fear of chargebacks, this could a death blow to theAchillesheal of bitcoins.
