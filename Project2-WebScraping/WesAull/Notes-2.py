# Notes:

# The series in both datasets are normalized by dividing by the
# total count for all queries in that week (us-weekly) or state
# (us-states). The normalization controls for the year over year
# growth in all Internet search use (us-weekly) and state-bystate
# variation in Internet usage (us-states). Finally, each time
# series is standardized to have a mean value of zero and a
# variance of one, so that queries can be easily compared.
