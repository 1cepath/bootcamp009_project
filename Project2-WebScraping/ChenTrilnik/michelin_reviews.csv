			Droves of curious downtowners continue their love affair with this cushy mainstay for Macanese cuisine. With nothing but a red light over a dark door to mark its entrance, make your way into this bi-level beauty, accoutered with heavy velvet drapes, double-height ceilings, and a dimly lit yet sexy bar. The mien is playful, buzz palpable, and first-rate drinks are flowing. Start with the Tuscan kale-and-romaine salad, enticingly smoky with texturally perfect potato ""croutons"" and paprika vinaigrette. Then, move on to a Taipa steamboat (cross between a Chinese hotpot and Portuguese paella) teeming with briny shellfish, fried chicken wings, and linguiça. Sample a slice of their chocolate diablo cake for an indulgent and notably decadent finish.

			Fantastic food is the sole focus of this Vietnamese dive. The décor-albeit stark-highlights a semi-tropical theme and the crowd might be touristy, but don't let that deter you as the food is wonderfully authentic and very reasonable. Condiments atop each table serve to enhance even the most humble goi cuon stuffed with grilled pork and vermicelli. Muc chien don is a plate of chewy, crisped squid tossed in salt, pepper, and tailed by cucumbers and red onion for ample tang; while the house special pho xe lua reveals a rich, savory broth full of noodles, brisket, and beef tendon. Combine this with sprouts, chilies, and herbs for a surefire delight. Enjoy dessert with a Vietnamese iced coffee that will give even your great-aunt Grace the shakes.

			Situated on a pier off the Hudson River, this three-story Victorian-a rambunctious New York landmark replete with a prominent clock tower and enormous promenade-is hardly your average watering hole. After all, where else can you slurp bivalves and sip craft beers among pressure gauges from 19th century steamships while taking in a view of the Statue of Liberty? The menu's tempting seafood options include a dozen types of fresh, plump oysters; lobster mac and cheese studded with greens and bacon and served in a cast iron skillet; as well as mini lobster rolls with a citrusy remoulade. While the fare here begs for brews, grown-ups craving quiet conversation, a proper martini, and an ultra-hearty Tomahawk steak should head upstairs to Pier A Harborhouse.

			First things first: You don't go to Nom Wah Tea Parlor for the décor or the service. The latter is polite and ultra-speedy, but otherwise forgettable. And the décor offers little more than pleather booths and a diner-style counter. None of this matters, for once the kitchen starts dropping its lip-smacking Chinese-American fare down with aplomb, you'll be in dim sum heaven. Begin with soft and tender shrimp-and-snow pea leaf dumplings, before moving on to unique bean curd skin rolls tucked with savory Chinese pork. Downright terrific pan-fried dumplings are filled with pink shrimp and fragrant chives. Don't leave without sampling the restaurant's ""Original Egg Roll,"" which is basically a massive umami bomb, easily split between four people.

			Tucked along the fringes of Alphabet City, a little taste of authentic Isaan Thai awaits. Originally based out of Bangkok, the New York outpost of Somtum Der offers a cozy little enclave for the East Village set, stylishly accented with bright pops of red, and a welcome glimpse of the kitchen's somtum station. There, you'll spy large glass jars of peanuts, dried red chilies, and spices-the contents of which are ground by mortar and pestle to produce what some claim is the city's best green papaya salad. Order big here, for the portions aren't massive and the food is so terrific you'll inevitably want more. The kitchen is happy to kick things up a notch, spice-wise, but you'll need to request the hotter end of the spectrum for greater authenticity.

			With a Spanish soul and tastefully raw space, Chef Seamus Mullen's Tertulia is big-hearted and boasts a surprisingly healthy side to its menu. The narrow room decked with a long wood bar and colorful tiles evokes those casual eateries in Spain, rife with a buzzing open kitchen and chalkboards scribbled with cheeses. The bites here are healthy but equally bright with flavor. Tosta matrimonio is a flax and quinoa crisp topped with black and white anchovies, slow-roasted tomato, and sharp sheep's milk cheese. Also, try bocata de delicata, a satisfying sandwich of slices of charred delicata squash, roasted red peppers, Swiss chard, and cheddar cheese.

			Thái So'n is by far the best of the bunch in this Vietnamese quarter of Chinatown. It's neither massive nor fancy, but it's bright, clean, and perpetually in business. One peek at the specials on the walls (maybe golden-fried squid strewn with sea salt) will have you begging for a seat in the crammed room. Speedy servers scoot between groups of City Hall suits and Asian locals as they order the likes of cha gio, pork spring rolls with nuoc cham; or goi cuon, fantastic summer rolls filled with poached shrimp and vermicelli.

Bo Ky's steamed-up windows (from the succulent meats roasting inside) are an invitation to come in and get cracking on a perfect bowl of wonton and noodle soup. Succulent braised duck is a house specialty here. Served with its sweetened dark soy braising liquid and pickled, crunchy daikon, this is a Teochew specialty but with a definite Vietnamese touch. Its textural interplay is as first-rate as the kitchen's other favorite item, namely a crispy fried shrimp-and-scallion roll wrapped in bean curd skin.

			This neighborhood tavern has the kind of food you could nosh on every day-and excellent versions of it, at that. Duck inside and you'll find a deep, narrow space with an elevated back dining room. Up front, a hip and hopping bar set amid a series of two-tops beckons lone diners and cozy lovebirds. Steak plays a big role in this kitchen's menu-and rightfully so, for it's fantastic. But almost everything here, from the seasonal greens to the delicious sides and fresh-from-the-skillet monkey bread, aims to please. A bright, crisp spring pea salad gets a salty hit of pecorino and drizzle of vinaigrette; while a dish named Don Ameche (beautifully-seared filet mignon fanned over sourdough toast spread with creamy chicken liver mousse) is downright brilliant.

Aim straight for the counter to appreciate the theatrics of it all, where orders are acknowledged with more shouts flying from Japanese servers to chefs. The energy is high, but so are the standards for their expertly grilled meats and vegetables. Kneeling cooks use long wooden paddles to deliver dishes hot off the robata, like gyu tataki, seared beef filet topped with tobiko and scallions on a bed of red onions with ponzu.

			There's a ton of Japanese restaurants that line this stretch of the East Village, so why Soba-Ya? Why not Soba-Ya, its ultra-dedicated patrons would argue-for the buckwheat soba as well as the hearty udon on tap here are consistently off-the-charts good. Co-owner and mini-mogul, Bon Yagi, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments. And here he employs that traditional aesthetic to sweet perfection; along with a graceful, but simply appointed dining space; and quiet, well-timed service. A meal might begin with sea urchin and grated mountain yam, kissed with wasabi and crispy, toasted nori; then transition to a seasonal noodle dish like warm soba mingled with plump, pickled oysters, mountain yam, cilantro and tempura root vegetables.

Enter carefully down a steep set of stairs to find low ceilings, large canvas artwork, and comfortable seating that lets you settle in and ponder just how very local the lettuce can be (answer: the rooftop). In fact, much of the produce here was harvested from their aeroponic rooftop gardens, while the rest is sourced from local purveyors. From start to finish, the American fare is consistently pleasing.

			Creative cuisine, attention to detail and stunning décor set Junoon apart from its upscale Indian associates. Step through the restaurant's ebony wood doors, and you'll find a dramatic, welcoming space adorned with treasures from the subcontinent. The large bar up front, replete with two antique jhoolas (swings) crafted from Burmese teak, delivers sophistication and fun-and by day, lunch is served in the light and airy (Patiala) room. Dinner guests are treated to the more theatrical room, walking along the length of the space through an ancient wooden arch and carved panels, seemingly afloat in a reflecting pool. This leads to an amber-tinted dining area where tables are luxuriously spaced. The overall effect is exotic, luxe and transporting-not easily forgotten. The talented kitchen team is particularly adept at bringing out contrasting flavors and textures in vegetarian dishes. A plate of kofta paneer, highlighting soft cottage cheese-like dumplings with a crisp exterior, puddled in a mustard-greens curry studded with English peas and abundant chilies, reaches epic heights when paired with a cheese-filled naan. But for a truly regal affair, opt for the chicken biryani-aromatic, moist and perfectly spiced.

The original carriage house was a butcher shop before becoming Vinegar Hill House-a lineage that seems apropos of such steady and perfectly delicious cooking. Chef/co-owner Jean Adamson's wood-fired fare is both rustic and enchanting. Start with a wintry fennel salad dressed in lemony olive oil and arranged with fronds over a swipe of burnt onion crème (think of the best onion dip you've ever had). Then, dig into a roasted half chicken with copious jus and a splash of snappy sherry vinegar served in a cast iron skillet. Dark and impossibly moist chocolate Guinness cake is outrageously good, beneath a thick layer of cream cheese frosting.

Turning the notion of service on its head, members of the kitchen step away from their stations to deliver their intricate compositions-each of them plated on hand thrown pottery. The briefest of descriptions is offered upon presentation, which means that a mouthful of ""grilled squash,"" for example, might also deliver raw slivers of pattypan, creamy peanut sauce, and a dusting of dried mint. Embellishments like foie gras and trout roe are used sparingly and to splendid effect, never outshining the true flavor of the produce. Semilla's bread is house-made, excellent, and used to accentuate the menu; as seen in a wedge of flax seed-barley sourdough with cultured butter to accompany a roasted carrot ""mille-feuille,"" alongside smoked potato purée and fava greens sauce. Although the duo of sweets to finish may include options that disappoint, dessert can also be an electrifying success as in the egg yolk-saffron sorbet, cloud of smoked cream, and passion fruit.

			Surprisingly mellow for a restaurant named after a Revolutionary War fort, this Southern tavern (of sorts) is a warm and inviting space where one meal can easily bleed into the next. With a reputation for cocktails, a classic wood bar, and tables covered in colorful oilcloths depicting flora and fauna, this is a lively but not-too-crowded watering hole with solid cooking and heaps of character. A meal could start with crostini topped with local ricotta, shiitake mushrooms, kale, and parmesan. On a blustery day in windswept Red Hook, perhaps the smoky lentil soup will do. Locals return time and again for classics like faultless deviled eggs dusted with paprika. A lean towards the South is seen in the hearty muffuletta of New Orleans fame.

			Just removed from the busy thoroughfare, find this understated gem adorned with little more than photographs of field-fresh produce, votives, and a tulip for each table. Service is as laid back and attentive as the ambience. That easygoing feel extends to the menu, which capitalizes on the best ingredients of the moment. Thanks to an impressive resume, Chef Patti Jackson's foundation in Italian cooking adds delicious dimension to this regional American food. Start off with an array of openers, ranging from the cool and bracing flavors of mustard-pickled sardines over arugula, to a paper-thin crostini topped with a quenelle of chicken liver pâté and julienned radish. The golden-brown chickweed pie is a signature for good reason. By the grace of the chef's upbringing in Pennsylvania Dutch country, her warm, yeasty pretzel rolls may be among the best on this side of the Delaware. Follow this with twice-cooked nuggets of buttery spaetzle composed with a springtime mélange of chopped morels and slivered green onion. End your meal on a strong, sweet note with a duo of desserts like almond cake topped with rhubarb compote, and a pitch-perfect panna cotta over a smear of lemon curd.

			It was only a matter of time before owner George Weld would have to find larger digs for his home of the city's best biscuits. Egg's ravenous following is now accommodated in a much larger location that's light and bright with seating at a number of counters and ample table space; yet it's still common to be faced with a queue. Breakfast is served all day, every day, and stars those fantastic buttermilk biscuits. The fresh-baked beauties are split open and smothered with pork sausage-studded sawmill gravy, stacked with country ham, house-made fig jam, and Vermont cheddar cheese; or simply accompanied by molasses, honey, or jelly. Lunchtime brings savory fare like Carolina kale wilted in a spicy tomato broth poured over a wedge of crumbly cornbread.

			This contemporary American small plates restaurant calls an industrial stretch of Gowanus home. Inside, you'll find a cozy, intimate space with exposed brick walls, filament light bulbs as well as a wood burning oven in the back of the dining room-it's that Brooklyn feel we've come to know and love, and Freek's Mill does it just so. The cuisine is seasonal, light, and fresh, with each plate delivering something unique and unexpected. Try the fried soft-shell crab-its streak of cashew butter balanced by a sweet and spicy sambal and chopped baby bok choy; or the deliciously caramelized barbecue kohlrabi with buttery grits and wilted mustard greens. Close out with a beautifully aged duck breast coupled with refried cranberry beans and a rosemary-honey glaze.

			Prime Meats stands tall and proud as a true original and local gem for German eats set to American beats. The booths in front are bright and snug, while bentwood chairs and net curtains tied into a knot add to that brasserie feel. A warm vibe and cheery servers complete the picture. Hand-crafted sausages and burgers are all the rage here. Nibble away on homemade pretzels while perusing the lunch menu, which may be simple and sandwich-focused, but always showcases a gutsy edge. Bold flavors shine through in a creamy roasted squash soup; jagerwurst, a lightly charred, delicately smoky, and meaty sausage with red cabbage casserole; or Jen's German potato salad tossing waxy potato slices, chopped herbs, and thick bacon lardons in a pickled dressing.

			French-born Chef Laurent Tourondel knows New Yorkers can never get enough pizza-especially not when it's this divine. The restaurant's stunning rustic-contemporary interior was conceived by Brooklyn-based design studio, Crème, and the look is a breath of fresh air-soft, warm lighting washes across an open layout room dotted with vibrant green plants, reclaimed slats, ceiling beams, and Windsor-style walnut chairs. The kitchen's ingredient-driven menu was built around its beautiful, copper-clad wood-fired ovens, so naturally, excellent pizzas and pastas abound. But, appetizers like veal-and-pork meatballs ""al forno"", and entrées like a wood oven-roasted chicken are tempting additions. Tack on one of their lovely cocktails for a full-on festa.

			Despite the fact that this sounds like Grandpa's pet-name for his antique tractor, The General Greene nicely straddles rusticity and hipness while serving three satisfying meals a day. Everything seems cool here, if perhaps a bit aloof, from the ambient lighting, comfy banquettes, and leather bar stools to their highly prized espresso machine and free WiFi for your iPad. The menu has a playful Southern slant, as seen in the signature buttermilk-fried chicken served with gravy and mashed potatoes. While wood-fired pizzas (the Margherita?) taunt palates by perfuming the entire space, Arctic char caramelized until crisp and coupled with yuzu as well as dried red chilies, is a special for fitting reason. Cast-iron skillets of bread pudding seem to fly out the door.

The results are distinct and delicious. Among the host of options to be tried are shoyu (soy-based), shio (salt-based), or the special house ramen brimming with a bounty of shellfish. A recent unique offering featured a fiery broth infused with a blend of 12 spices and fish sauce and filled with bone-in pork rib, cabbage, and red chilies. Slurp your soup at one of two seating options in the moody, dark-walled space: perched atop tall tables or at a counter looking into the kitchen, where a refrigerator unit is stocked with custom-made noodles.

Sleek black ceiling pendants light the tables, where the kitchen's delicious and creative Asian plates hit in happy abundance. The Arkansas-reared chef has always loved Vietnamese cooking-and here, he ups the ante by implementing local and seasonal produce into his playful take on the same region's fare. The dinner menu features dishes like grilled pork chop with cucumber salad, fried egg, and jasmine rice; or a riff on jambalaya starring smoked pork sausage, Carolina shrimp, and crab paste.

Quality ingredients and a skilled kitchen combine with delicious results as in hariyali chooza, nuggets of white meat chicken marinated in an herbaceous blend of mint, cilantro, green fenugreek, chilies, and hung curd; or the unique house specialty galouti kebab, made from fragrantly spiced lamb ground so fine and incredibly tender that it's almost pâté-smooth. Hearty dishes such as khatte baingan, silky chunks of eggplant stewed in a tangy onion-tomato masala and garnished with pickled ginger root, wrap up temptations.

Inside, the colorful dining room features a u-shaped bar and bustling open kitchen; while the café up front offers sandwiches and pastries to-go.

			It takes serious effort for an Indian restaurant to stand out from the crowd in jam-packed Curry Hill, but by highlighting the cuisine of Calcutta and its faction of Jewish immigrants, this desi diner does just that. Haldi translates to turmeric in Hindi, and the space is fittingly decorated with splashes of yellow throughout. Executive Chef Hemant Mathur heads up this operation, where a cadre of skilled cooks routinely turn out the likes of such unique plates as mangshor chop, a crunchy ground lamb-and-potato patty served with cilantro chutney; or fish-fry Calcutta-style served with mustard-and-onion relish. Chicken makmura, featuring minced chicken meatballs cooked in a rich, creamy curry made from almonds and cashews, makes for a fine finale.

			More than just an icon of the New York dining scene-Peter Luger is an idolized classic. Run on wheels by a team of gloriously forthright waiters, this munificent paean to beef doesn't just serve legendary steaks, it provides a side helping of history too. The wood paneling and beer-hall tables tell of family gatherings, friends united, deal making, success celebrated and stories swapped. It's evocative and unforgettable. It's also unapologetically old-school-computerization and credit cards remain fanciful futuristic concepts, so you'll need to come with a few Benjamins tucked into your wallet. Start with a thick slice of bacon to get your taste buds up to speed before the steak arrives. These slabs of finely marbled Porterhouse are dry-aged in-house for around 28 days, which means there's tenderloin on one side of the bone and strip steak on the other. They are then broiled to perfection, sliced before being brought to the table, and served with their own sauce as well as a host of sides, which range from their version of German fried potatoes to creamed spinach. If you can still feel a pulse after that, there's always cheesecake served with their equally famous ""schlag"" to finish you off.

Originally opened in 2004, owners Heather Belz & Mani Dawes offer a scrumptious array of small plates like creamy black rice plated with shaved cuttlefish and pale green parsley purée; or a thick wedge of potato-studded tortilla Española, laced with delicious garlicky aïoli.

			Pippali offers a pleasing study on the myriad regional cuisines of India with an array of sensational curries, seafood dishes, and so much more. On-point service makes it a dream destination for date night or dinner with friends, and a muted color scheme in the sleek dining room provides an ideal backdrop for the kitchen's rout of boldly seasoned dishes.

The monochromatic white interior has taken a beating over the years, but that's easy to look past when the eats are as cheap and tasty as these. The completely vegetarian menu is an authentic array of curries, breads, and weekend-only biryani, but the real head-turners are those table-long dosas. They arrive as crisp, tactile favorites on a metal tray ready to be picked apart and dunked into luscious sambar and refreshing chutneys. The milagai podi onion dosa, a crispy rice-and lentil-flour crêpe spread with dried spices and a deliciously offensive amount of chopped red onion, is just one of many worthwhile treats.

			Tucked next to the steely skeleton of the Williamsburg Bridge, Meadowsweet cuts a stylish industrial figure with its glass-fronted façade, whitewashed brick walls, and original mosaic-tiled floors. Leather banquettes line the wall, and pendant bulbs illuminate one of several beautiful oil paintings of a meadow. Inside, the restaurant jumps with Williamsburg's finest -along with more than a few bridge-hoppers from Manhattan and beyond. And that's on a slow night. The fuss is quite merited. Despite ample competition in this section of town, Chef/owner Polo Dobkin and wife, Stephanie Lempert, manage to elevate the kitchen's dishes into next level territory, and they do so in a lovely, urbane setting with loads of charm and friendly service. The inventive American menu gets a lift from Mediterranean accents: a bowl of deliciously chewy squid ink ""fettuccine"" arrives with Spanish octopus, chorizo, hot chili and breadcrumbs; while tender duck finds its match in braised red cabbage, poached Seckel pear, and roasted Bartlett pear-and-black currant coulis.

			Now firmly settled into its Chelsea home in a former tavern, Ushiwakamaru may no longer have that underground feel of a sushi-ya that only the most dedicated aficionados know about. However, it remains home to luxe sushi and excellent fish. The brief menu lists wallet-friendly à la carte specials, small plates, and cooked items like sautéed lobster and asparagus, but you may choose to ignore all that. Chef Hideo Kuribara's true focus is on the very impressive omakase, served as a choice of 14 or 20 superb courses. A bowl of pickled cucumber stimulates the appetite as a series of cold dishes arrive, with highlights like chopped horse mackerel with green onion and shiso leaf. Then move on to sashimi that proves just how incredibly fresh the fish here is. Delve into perfectly cut octopus simply dressed with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon; or needlefish served with a bowl of grated ginger, green onion slivers, and soy for dipping. Each morsel of nigiri is crafted at the dining counter and presented on a ceramic slab, ready to be plucked with your fingers. Expect large, cool mouthfuls of Japanese sea urchin, lightly torched fatty tuna with truffle salt, and rich shad brushed with soy.

			This elder member of David Chang's culinary empire is hipper and hotter than ever. A honey-toned temple of updated comfort food, decked with blonde wood counters and a sparkling open kitchen, the service here may be brisk. But rest assured, as the menu is gutsy and molded with Asian street food in mind. Those steamed buns have amassed a gargantuan following thanks to decadent fillings like moist pork loin kissed with Hollandaise and chives. Additionally, that bowl of springy noodles doused in a spicy ginger-scallion sauce is just one instance of the crew's signature work. Korean fried chicken with seasonal greens is fit for a king; while more modest items, including desserts like candy apple truffle, are beautifully crafted and rightfully elevated to global fame.

			The spotlight shines here on the seriously talented Chef Noboyuki Shikanai and commands the rear room's attention as he performs his magic before the few coveted seats along his omakase counter. Beyond this, the space has a row of tables where you might observe a group indulging in a tuna rib that appears large enough to have come from a cow: first sliced raw, then cooked to enjoy this incredibly fresh fish both ways. Ancillary rooms almost feel like a sushi-ya within a sushi-ya. The service team is swift and friendly even as they work in the shadow of their master. Kanoyama's omakase is a profoundly personal experience, as Chef Shikanai slices, cuts, and brushes, dabs, and perfects each morsel before presenting it to you with cupped hands, to be taken with your fingers. Pieces are precisely crafted yet delicate and beautiful in that traditional Edo-mae style. Overall, the meal is a progression from light, firm fish to vivid, buttery salmon and toro with exciting stops along the way, like cherry trout hakozushi (box-pressed) or jackfish with grains of Icelandic sea salt and a drizzle of lemon. Finish with an extraordinary block of cake-like tamago topped with a silken yolk.

			It all starts with the dough. That said, Ribalta's mother version apparently started nearly a century ago and has been kept alive to feed the masses since. Today, it rises for 72 hours before being baked into a crust that is so light and digestible that you might be tempted to go for a second, very authentic Margherita, topped with that perfect balance of tomato sauce, mozzarella, olive oil, and basil. Pasta dishes are just as strong, so sample a duo of wonderfully tender gnocchi, thickly dressed in pesto or an excellent penne rigate con ragù Napolitano loaded with ground pork and beef. The food may be substantial, but the space feels like La Grande Mela thanks to red leather banquettes, creatively tiled white walls, and planks suspended from the lofty ceiling.

			Jimmy Lau and Nick Kin, both Masa alumni, have created a cool, high-end sushi bar for a young and eager crowd. They've certainly nailed the ultra-discreet façade-anyone who's eaten out in Tokyo will know the feeling of walking past a place a couple of times before finding its door. The centerpiece of the windowless room is the three-sided counter fashioned out of white ash-it's a thing of beauty which you'll find yourself unable to resist stroking every now and again. Drinks aside you have just one choice to make-to have the omakase or the marginally more expensive kaiseki. Even for Edomae-style sushi, the size is quite diminutive, with the best pieces being those that push a little at the boundaries. The rice could be better but there's no doubting the quality of the fish.

			Let the awards, accolades and press keep coming-for there is still nothing quite like David Chang's beloved Ko. Head down a quiet alley in the otherwise hopping East Village, and you'll come upon a door sporting only Chang's proverbial peach. Behind it lies a gorgeous, street-hip space with 40 seats, 22 of them forming a U-shaped counter around the bustling and open kitchen. There is no à la carte at Ko, only the multi-course menu for the evening, which you're given in print. Dishes are delivered by the chefs, who briefly describe each ingredient while servers slip seamlessly between guests filling drinks. It's a unique style that brings you right into the action. Dave Chang is a veritable rock star chef by any standard (and longtime lieutenant Sean Gray is something like his Keith Richards)-so you're in expert hands from the start. The strength of his food lies as much in its texture as in its taste: fresh black bass is paired with jalapeño, shiso and consommé jelly; while charcoaled potato in lobster emulsion is topped with herbs for a simple, but otherworldly, dish. A buttery slice of duck farce pie, studded with black truffle and paired with sunchokes and turnip, is a culinary revelation.

			Warm, personable, and genuine, this elegant idol has everything a New York restaurant needs to stand the test of time. Inside, find towering floral arrangements and lofty ceilings hung with fabric-draped fixtures, which soften the room's appearance. The interior is vast, but the sunken dining area, elevated bar, and smartly divided room feel more classic than overdone. The service team exemplifies on-the-ball excellence. This kitchen's distinctive seasonal American cooking is a reminder that good food never goes out of style. Begin with the clean and bright flavors of a simple-sounding seafood salad combining succulent shrimp, tender lobster meat, and grilled Spanish octopus in citrus vinaigrette garnished with salad greens. Move on to explore pasta like Taleggio-filled tortellini in a creamy sauce dotted with butternut squash and tender chopped chicken. Desserts alone are worth a visit, especially to indulge in the elegant and picture-perfect apple tarte Tatin for two, filled with fruit so tender their centers are as lush as custard. Caramelized juices oozing from the apples lend complex flavor to the flaky golden pastry crust. The greenmarket lunch prix-fixe offers superb value and quality.

			It's the way of the modern world that we think of the changing of the seasons more in terms of our wardrobe rather than our food-but a meal at Kajitsu could change that. This Japanese vegan restaurant serves shojin cuisine based on the precepts of Buddhism­-if you're in search of an antidote to the plethora of steakhouses in the city, this is it. The traditionally decorated space on the second floor is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility and offers table or counter seating and service that is as charming as it is earnest. Such is the skill of the kitchen you'll forget in no time about the absence of fish or meat. It's all about balance, harmony and simplicity-and allowing the ingredients' natural flavors to shine, whether it's the delicate onion soup with mizuna and potato, or the visually arresting hassun which could include everything from mountain yam to burdock root. Your period of contemplation and newfound respect for your fellow man may come to a juddering halt when you find yourself back on Lexington but, for a few moments at least, you'll feel you connected with nature.

			Boasting soothing textured walls the color of sand, sturdy but comfortable furnishings, and cool slate flooring, this serene and serious space is just what one would expect of a high-end Japanese dining room. But, beyond this quotidian look is a kitchen that turns out very exciting-and quite unexpected-food. Tables are an available option, but a seat facing Chef Toshio Tomita at the pristine elm counter is the place to be. While the menu offers both à la carte dining and a sushi-only omakase, the Chef's Counter omakase is by far the best experience to be had here. This meal begins with a playful platter of bites (envision smoked ham katsu) to break the ice and stimulate the palate for the kitchen's sparkling sashimi. Slices of Hokkaido octopus, marinated bonito, and snapper are a treat, dressed not only with freshly ground wasabi root and top-notch soy sauce, but also the chef's signature chimichurri-a touch of fusion that signals his decade-plus years of working at Nobu. Another highlight is the chilled handmade soba served with spicy buckwheat sprouts and a divine dipping sauce. Cooked dishes, like fried soft-shell crab with watermelon salad, and impressive nigiri round out Cagen's kappo-style meal.

			Named for the 19th century Supreme Court case that ultimately decided tomatoes are indeed a vegetable, Nix is a bright young starlet backed by some heavy hitters. Chefs John Fraser (of Dovetail's beloved meatless Mondays) and Nicolas Farias are crafting a vegetarian cuisine that makes you wonder if meat might be holding back vegetables-here they shine without it. The service team is as on-point and well-versed as a letter from the editor (Condé Nast's former Editorial Director is a partner and frequently oversees the dining room). No surprise that it fills with a unique crowd of fashionista foodies that are as visually appealing as those light fixtures sculpted from juniper roots. Green plants and skylights keep everything looking healthy and bright-it's a welcoming scene. The two à la carte menus offer intriguing vegetarian options or a more concise vegan one, which has many of the same compositions minus the dairy. Playful highlights include crisply charred avocado a la plancha served in a pool of tomato water, salted and spiked with jalapeño, finished with bits of fresh mozzarella. Fuji apple sorbet begins as a fragrant dessert, then pops with the inventive flavors of candied olive and lime.

Start with a salad of roasted beets, crisp endive, and grassy watercress in apple-vinaigrette capped with a coin of pistachio-crusted goat cheese. Classic daily specials are always a hit, like Monday's baked lasagna, Tuesday's Bourbon-glazed meatloaf, or Wednesday's lemon sole almondine served with cauliflower gratin and tender haricots verts.

			Austrian cuisine is known for being hearty and immeasurably satisfying, but the great strength of Wallsé is that you don't have to have spent the day skiing in Innsbruck to appreciate its cooking because the adept kitchen has a lightness of touch and is not rigidly tied to tradition. There are some foods that just feel right at certain times of the year. When the nights draw in and there's a little chill in the air, there are certain words whose very presence on a menu summon feelings of comfort and warmth-and those words surely include spaetzle, schnitzel, and strudel. Whether you've chosen the gamey and fork-tender venison cheek goulash or have gone for the tafelspitz, you'll find that the dishes here are harmonious, nicely balanced, easy to eat, and even easier to return to enjoy again and again. The restaurant is divided into two rooms, both dominated by striking paintings that may even portray the chef himself. The clientele is a largely sophisticated bunch with an inherent understanding of how restaurants work which, in turn, creates an easy, relaxing atmosphere. The wine list also merits examination, if only to discover there's more to Austrian wine than Grüner Veltliner.

			A casual tavolata with a lovely back garden, Gnocco is a neighborhood staple with a homey touch. The restaurant charms with creaky wood floors and exposed brick walls accented by abstract paintings. The wood-burning oven at the entrance sets a warm tone, and greets guests with the heady aroma of freshly baked bread. The signature gnocco (sweet, salty pillows of fried bread) can be ordered as an appetizer, side, or even as a dessert with Nutella. Pizzas shine on this carb-centric menu, thanks to that blistered thin crust hanging over the plate's edge. The Amatriciana layers tart tomato sauce with sweet red onion, shreds of pancetta, and a heavy-handed sprinkle of red pepper flakes. The torta al cioccolato with chocolate mousse makes a fine dessert.

			Trust us, you need Momofuku Ssäm Bar in your life. Inside this perennial favorite, you'll find a hip, young crowd rubbing elbows at the minimalist bar or sinking into low-slung tables to chat up their dinner companions. It's a fun, convivial ambience, no question-but the star of the show here is indisputably Chang's singular Korean and Japanese cooking style, which flirts with European and Californian influences. There's perfectly sourced charcuterie and a lovely raw bar to kick things off, but don't leave without moving on to Ssäm legendary pork buns-pillow-soft and laced with hoisin sauce, cucumber, and scallions. Or even a tender Flat Iron steak, grilled to perfection, and paired with chicharrón chips, ramps, and broiled asparagus tips.

			When New Yorkers dream of living in the West Village, Barbuto has a place in that dream, too. Springtime lunches with garage doors open to the sidewalk, and a feast of refined, simple dishes have earned Jonathan Waxman a devoted following in a neighborhood already full of charming restaurants. Casually professional service and the dimly lit dining room's dose of California cool enhance the experience. Barbuto's roast chicken deserves its legendary status, but other dishes tempt too. A cavolo nero salad of thinly sliced black kale and crunchy breadcrumbs tossed in a creamy dressing of anchovies and pecorino puts the average kale salad to shame. Linguini is coated with black pepper, egg, pancetta, and cheese in one indelible plate of carbonara.

			Blenheim's been buzzing around the food world for good reason. Clearly, it takes its farm-to-table ethos seriously as the restaurant draws vegetables and livestock of guinea hens, black angus beef and heritage pig from its very own farm upstate. There may be no more genuine expression of this kitchen than the farm eggs-their yolk bright, orange and fresh. Other technically impressive dishes may highlight chestnut pappardelle with pork ragout, or braised beef short rib paired with roasted sunchoke and maitake mushrooms. Combined with a sultry and chic interior, featuring plush upholstery, pearly white bar stools, and smoky globes that drop down over tables, the effect is sublime. Date-night material, indeed.

			What started out as a Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Brooklyn has grown into a global chain with locations in Hong Kong and Manila. Cloaked in the scent of wood-fired pies, Motorino is praised as an all-day spot that's easy on the wallet. True, it may be smaller than the newer, slightly grander Williamsburg outpost, but these pizzas leave nothing to be desired. Blackboard specials convey the product-focused sensibilities that begin with a lunchtime prix-fixe pairing a green salad of mint, beet greens, and red onion in balsamic vinaigrette with a perfectly charred and chewy pie. The foundation of each pizza is its outstanding crust spread with crushed tomatoes, gobs of melting fresh mozzarella, and perhaps a generous layering of spicy sausage slices.

There are ample windows for people-watching, or let your eyes wander to the botany drawings along the walls and bird sculptures decorating nooks.

It is one of those places that manage the rare trick of being so confident in its abilities that it can be all things to all people.

The ""Tavern"" side is the better one for lunch, especially if there are only two of you and you can sit at the bar-it doesn't take bookings so get here early and join in the grown-up ""I'm not really queuing, I'm just standing here"" queue outside. The ""Dining Room"" is for those who like a little more pomp with their pappardelle, and really comes into its own in the evening. The cooking is the perfect match for the warm and woody surroundings: this is American food sure of its footing and unthreatening in its vocabulary. The main component, be it sea bass or pork loin, is allowed to shine and there is a refreshing lack of over-elaboration on the plate that demonstrates the confidence of the kitchen.

			The best way to describe the lovely Take Root is that it feels like an extraordinarily well-curated dinner party. The tiny restaurant is a two-woman operation: Chef Elise Kornack single-handedly runs the immaculate kitchen while her wife, Anna Hieronimus, amiably tends to the tranquil dining room. If you're lucky enough to score one of the precious few seats here, make it your mission to arrive on time. The tasting menu's procession begins promptly, so stragglers may run the risk of missing out on those first luscious bites. And that would be wrong. Once seated, you're treated to a wonderfully relaxed and delicious experience. The décor is thankfully simple but soothing, with walnut tables and minimally dressed white walls. A wonderful playlist plays overhead. Substitutions are not offered, but there's little chance you won't be happy with what's to come. Kornack weaves her culinary spell deftly, gracing blue point oysters with dots of ""oyster pudding,"" aromatic chives and puffed buckwheat; or setting turnip, toasted almond, horseradish and celery over a disc of parmesan custard. Tortellini then arrives filled with luscious cranberry bean purée and bathed in a green tomato- chili- and pork jus.

As the name suggests, guests «craft» together a meal from seasonal, perfectly executed dishes featuring pristine ingredients. Dinner might kick off with a cured slice of crudo, served with shaved fennel, radish and micro greens in a Meyer lemon dressing. Don't leave without trying one of Chef Colicchio's legendary pastas, like a gorgeous tangle of capellini with lemon zest, grated cheese, ramps and Calabrian chilies.

			Cull & Pistol is a sensational seafood spot. This breath of fresh salt-laden air is replete with reclaimed teak tables, brushed steel chairs, and a zinc-topped raw bar groaning with crimson-red crab claws, chilled lobster, shrimp cocktail, and clams from all shores. It's an impressive start tailed by a vast oyster menu and deeply comforting classics that may be slurped up at two-tops inside the cozy space. Then, a whole fish salt-baked in a hefty cask is cracked open, teasing diners with plumes of thyme- and lemon-scented steam. At lunch, the clambake is a briny, heavenly mash-up of lobster, mussels, Dickson's sausage, corn on the cob and fingerling potatoes, served family-style in a rich shellfish broth. Dessert is pure and sweet bliss.

			Jean-Georges Vongerichten's farm-to-table restaurant lets you indulge your cravings whilst playing up your eco credentials, because this is a place that takes its social responsibilities seriously and whose ethos is writ large upon the menu, with suppliers acknowledged and policies explained. They describe their extensive menu as ""locally sourced and globally artistic."" Fortunately their food is more convincing than their semantics-the glossy tuna sashimi is served at just the right temperature; a burger is pepped up with pickled jalapeños; and a toothsome panna cotta comes with delicious glazed figs. This accent on freshness finds its reflection in the pure white wholesomeness of the place and the youthful enthusiasm of the service team.

The space flows from an inviting front lounge to a cozy back dining room, dressed with burlap ceiling pendants and ivory terrazzo flooring. Go for the three or four-course prix-fixe dinner to experience this clever and delightful cuisine. Creamy anchovy dressing and meaty bacon join in the chef's take on this classic reinterpretation of a wedge salad. Risotto-style beluga lentils balance intense mushroom stock with a subtle hit of jalapeños. Many dishes highlight delicious restraint, like the pan-roasted branzino with foamy and mild foie-gras veloute. Finish with the slender bar of chocolate torte with white chocolate-miso ganache and fennel ice cream.

			Located just below street level on frenetic Atlantic Avenue, a nondescript façade holds a quiet den of serious Neapolitan pizza magic. Enter and you'll find a simple, narrow, wood-paneled room with whitewashed brick walls; a little bar showcasing a handful of wines; an enormous, two-ton clay oven (imported directly from Naples); and a little patio out back for alfresco dining. The mood is decidedly relaxed, and while there are delicious salads, antipasti, and desserts to be tried at Sottocasa, the name of the game here is undoubtedly their wickedly good pizza, served folded, bianche or rosse (with-hurrah!-a gluten-free option as well). Regulars adore the Diavola pie, which comes laced with excellent mozzarella, fresh basil, black olives, and hot sopressata.

But, what truly sets it apart is an ability to serve exactly what you crave without seeming trite or predictable. Even the look is a perfectly conjured mix of warm neutrals with a sleek yet informal Northern Italian style and impeccably timed servers. Start with the traditional antipasto and then proceed to one of the daily specials like veal Milanese or a lavish dish of garganelli with mushrooms and black truffles.

Instead, the look is understated with wood slats, ikebana, and muted tones. Ootoya's budget-friendly pricing ensures a full house.

			A perfect climate and great scenery­-it's easy to see the appeal of life on the Mediterranean. George Mendes' cheerful restaurant may not transport you there, but you will leave feeling as though your serotonin levels have received a timely boost. Those who like to eat while deciding what to eat will delight in an appealing petisco or snack-the crisp and refreshing gin and tonic macaron for example-served to kick off the four-course meal. The menu reflects the seasons and is full of dishes to match that Southern European climate: they are bright, sunny, and you feel they are doing you good. Nothing says the Med more than bacalhau-here served grilled and set over earthy-sweet sunchoke purée, finished tableside with enriched soy sauce. The kitchen is equally adept at more warming, comforting dishes-try the grilled quail with butternut squash and pumpkin seeds. Aim for items that remain truer to their Portuguese heritage rather than Japanese embellishments. The restaurant comes decorated with birch wood and shades of blue and is spread over two narrow rooms. Thanks to the open kitchen, the first floor has more buzz, but ask for the more intimate mezzanine level if on a date.

Then consider the service, which moves like clockwork and confirms that this is no slipshod show. The staff may be brisk in their presentation of the kitchen's ambitious renditions of tapas, but with flavors so delicious and concepts inventive, so be it. A faithful mix of locals and hungry out-of-towners convene for fantastic bite-sized eats like buttery bone marrow with smoked caper chermoulah-a house signature that is rich, flavorful, and entirely unmissable. Even the humble bacalao fritter attains new heights here as a deep-fried, fluffy delight coupled with sweet-citrusy alioli. Lastly, fallback plates like razor clams a la plancha in garlic-parsley sauce remain outstanding, consistent, and full of Spanish soul. This kitchen isn't frightened to explore, so skill and innovation are at the forefront of every morsel, including the thick, creamy, and luscious crema Catalana con buñuelos.

			Chef Alexandra Raij knows her tapas. She helped kickstart the craze in Manhattan when she opened her beloved Tia Pol years ago. From there, she moved on to the equally popular El Quinto Pino. And in 2012, she brought her beloved style to Brooklyn via La Vara, which she co-owns with her husband, Eder Montero. It's been a hit since day one. La Vara bills itself as ""cocina casera"" or home cooking, but this tapas den elevates the humble cuisine to such impressive levels that it's well worth the cab trip for non-Brooklynites. Product quality is excellent, and the playful spirit at work in the lineup of cold and hot small plates is the definition of creative cooking. Think crunchy fried sea anemone served in a chilled purée of almonds, bread, and garlic, drizzled with huitlacoche oil; or tender rabbit loin puddled in delicious sweet onion vinaigrette. Tucked into a charming brownstone-lined enclave of Cobble Hill, this small, slender space is chic and cozy, with red brick walls and a little white marble counter lined with glossy, high-backed chairs. A curved tan leather booth and small white tables dot the room. It's an atmosphere meant to put you at ease, with a menu guaranteed to wow.

			Downtown New York will always be a place for contemporary fine dining, but Chef Seeger boldly goes against the tide of others offering serious cooking in casual settings. Here, find a dining room that feels like a part of his own home, decorated with his own artwork, wine collection, floral arrangements, and tiered drum chandeliers covered in rosy fabric. Much of the staff wear a formal mien and the orchestrated service reflects that-as do their uniforms, which are as serious as American Gothic, but still modern. Local farmers and producers influence the nightly tasting menu with exquisite ingredients that shine in the kitchen's very capable hands. This is the eponymous chef's first foray into NY's dining scene (he is still a household name in his previous home city of Atlanta). And here he crafts a seasonal cuisine that is refined and elegant, yet also restrained and muted. Highlights include a cool and intensely fresh snap pea gazpacho with wild mint and shallots, followed by a supremely tender beef tenderloin in a pinot noir-jus reduction. Desserts like the rote grütze (red groats) with vanilla cream and green juniper berries make it immediately clear why this is a kitchen of serious standing.

			It takes a special talent to bridge the gap between Brooklyn and Northeast Thailand, but Chef Andy Ricker does so deftly, having dedicated his life to the study of Northern Thai cuisine. Pok Pok Ny is the delicious manifestation of that education, along with his ongoing travels. Tucked into the Columbia Street waterfront district, this casual spot offers seating along a long bar, as well as at little tables covered in checkered colorful plastic. Service is equally laid-back-the young, trendy servers mill about in chambray shirts, while crooning Thai pop music wafts overhead. Don't leave without trying the khao soi kai, a rich coconut curry with springy egg noodles and tender chicken; or laap, a warm hand-minced pork salad.

Food voyeurs should vie for a seat at the bar, where they can eye fresh seafood lined up in plump, shimmering rows or enjoy the action behind the glass wall of the semi-open kitchen. Otherwise, a seat in the bustling dining room, decked out in gorgeous Portuguese tiles and hip lobster-trap lights, ought to do the trick. Try the espargos assados, a dish of tender, spit-grilled spring asparagus topped with shaved dried sea urchin, sorrel, olive oil and a dust of sea salt; or the wickedly good frango piri-piri, grilled to perfection and served with its mouthwatering namesake pepper sauce.

The eclectic menu roams across Asia with a bevy of stir-fried, sizzled, and steamed dishes, each of them as deliciously flavorful and balanced as the last. Subtlety reigns in the crispy bits of fried beef dressed with a nicely calibrated sweet and spicy orange sauce; while fried rice is revved up with potent Thai green curry paste and pocked with shrimp, egg, and basil.

The atmosphere is relaxed but focused, and the omakase is surprisingly well-priced for this neighborhood. Secluded booths offer a sexy vibe for date night, where couples can ring a bell for service. And Akariba, a cool little cash-only bar connected to the restaurant next door, serves up such treats as oysters and sake. In addition to the à la carte and dessert menus, this kitchen also offers three variations on omakase: traditional, vegetarian, and wheat-free.

Like Maialino, Marta is helmed by Chef Nick Anderer and boasts a Roman accent. But, that's where the similarities end. Crispy, thin-crust pizza is the main attraction on this pasta-free menu: the Margherita, for instance, is a crackling delight from the pizze rosse listing, while the anatra combining duck confit, fennel, and golden raisins is a novel pizze bianche.

Wherever you sit, you'll find the service confident and engaging and the menu hugely appealing.

Chicken-which, if we're honest, would be the final meal of choice of many of us-is the undoubted star; they roast a whole bird, pimp it up with foie gras and black truffle and serve it for two.

The tiny kitchen at the back of the minimally decorated room belies the abundance of brilliance delivered by the short and sweet menu. Caserecci tossed with petite, al dente cauliflower florets, capers, currants, and a showering of crunchy breadcrumbs is a treat. Choosing the smaller portion size allows for more room to enjoy the lamb duo-rare seared loin and slow-braised belly-composed with a chickpea-and-piquillo pepper stew slicked with gorgeous lamb jus. For dessert, the chocolate mille-feuille with mint ganache and Fernet Branca whipped cream is like a Thin Mint made by very talented and very sophisticated Girl Scouts.

			Nestled behind a little specialty goods store offering excellent bread, coffee and to-go items, the popular Marlow & Sons sports a rustic hideaway vibe-replete with thick wood communal tables and flickering votives. The place is charming enough to warrant a visit even if the food wasn't ace, but as it happens, the rotating breakfast, lunch and dinner menus are divine. Kick things off with a smoky bowl of tomato soup sporting a delicate flutter of basil leaves; and then move on to the scrumptious brick chicken, a menu mainstay of moist chicken legs that get their crisp skin from being cooked under a brick. Paired with seasonal sides like a soft pile of corn, caramelized onions and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes, the result is homespun bliss.

			Finally, Chef Fredrik Berselius has opened this second incarnation of Aska, and it is already a must on any serious diner's list. The cuisine is his own Nordic fusion of the Northeast's bounty, importing as little as possible and showcasing produce from the Catskills, as well as the restaurant's own plot at the nearby Farm on Kent. The interior has a theatrical quality; the dining room is purposefully dark as if to heighten its contrast with the overly bright open kitchen. Chefs often come forward to present certain courses, as if breaking the fourth wall. The heart of Aska's innovation is in its use of myriad cooking techniques, like fermentation, smoking, and preserving. Elements of dining here are more about discovery than comfort, and may focus on an introduction to new tastes. Lamb's heart slowly cooked with hay down to ash served with pickled sunchoke purée is unforgettable, but whether it is pleasurable may be a source of debate. The carefully composed Finnish Carelian caviar with grilled onion bulbs, cultured cream, and ramp seeds in a complex lemon verbena-onion broth is extraordinary in presentation and flavor. Courses may ebb and flow, but the overall experience is fantastic.

Dining here is like visting at an old friend's house, starting with drinks in the living room and ending on the back porch. But with much better food. The chive buttermilk biscuit is a distinctive, flaky force to be reckoned with. Clear Southern flavors are further explored with sour pickles and thick slices of green tomatoes both dredged in cornmeal and deep-fried to piping hot perfection, served with buttermilk dressing, avocado salad, tomato jam, and hatch chile salsa. Small plates like ""big damn shrimp"" do not disappoint, but save room for the superb cornflake-topped crumble for two.

A slender hallway opens up into a narrow dining hall featuring dark walls; tufted velvet banquettes; and a backyard dining area topped by a retractable roof. The Spanish cuisine, skillfully rendered by chef and San Sebastian native, Luis Bollo, arrives as intricate tapas or hearty large plates, depending on your appetite. Tuck into arroz brut a la plancha, a tender, griddled cake of short grain brown rice, studded with savory merguez, peas, and raisins; or baked fideuà sauced with squid ink and topped with shaved sepia, garlicky aïoli and watercress sprouts.

An excellent starter of cheese popovers arrive light as a feather, their golden crust giving way to a savory, custardy filling.

By the time a rich Italian red touches your lips, and that crusty baguette with an irresistible globe of cultured cream speckled with black pepper and emerald-green olive oil hits the table, you are basking in the splendor of it all.

But save room for house-made lasagna with braised rabbit ragù, creamy béchamel, and sweet root vegetables; tender razor clams in a fragrant white wine broth; succulent porchetta studded with garlic and rosemary; or stewed and perfectly chewy trippa alla Romana.

			Blue Ribbon stays open until the wee hours, serving somewhat simple but particularly memorable food to SoHo's stylish set. Moreover, this unaffectedly warm and very classic bistro boasts zero pretense and deserves all praise that comes its way. Its décor may have stayed the same through the years-think timeless-but those bar seats remain a hot ticket. This ""chef's canteen"" as it is typically hailed is well-tread for masterpieces like fresh shucked oysters; smoked trout salad tossed with sour cream and zippy horseradish; or matzo ball soup-enjoyable, aromatic, and full of root vegetables. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes takes home the gold medal for comfort classics, while banana-walnut bread pudding with caramel sauce is the very essence of decadence.

			Push through the dark red velvet curtain into Rubirosa's narrow, dimly lit dining room to discover how very cool nonna can be. Although it may be loud and cramped with the requisite 80's tunes blaring overhead, this adept Italian-American kitchen is bright with classic dishes and an heirloom Staten Island pizza recipe that's 55-years-old and counting. The classic pie balances a crispy, cracker-thin crust with tart tomato sauce and oven-browned spots of salty, melting mozzarella. And the handmade pastas are highly recommended-you can't go wrong with a bowl of chewy chittara and its three hefty and hearty meatballs. Half portions allow diners to enjoy more of the favorable cooking here, and gluten-free pasta and pizza ensures everyone can enjoy it.

Sporting a small, but sharply designed interior by Louis Yoh, replete with schoolhouse chairs and reclaimed bowling alley wood tables, Houseman's seasonal menu isn't extensive, but each dish is extremely well-sourced-not to mention well-executed, with the help of co-chef, Adam Baumgart. Kick things off with a grilled tomato salad, bursting with fresh herbs, salty feta and smoky shishito peppers.

			Can't afford a trip to Thailand? No problem. This transporting little gem-compliments of talented husband-wife duo Matt Danzer and Ann Redding-brings the Northern Thai experience stateside with creative cuisine and whimsical drinks-Singha beer slushies anyone? Tucked along the eastern edge of Spring Street, the dining room is den-like. A vibrant crowd keeps the place popping through the night, as does the gentle stream of Thai pop music in the background. Though tables are mini, the kitchen feels immense in its creative vision-a window into where the magic happens offers views of a slow-rotating rotisserie and crackling embers. Danzer and Redding's dishes are certainly rooted in this nation's cuisine, but they give each dish a unique spin thereby infusing vibrant flavor into small plates, large plates, ""charcoal-grilled goodies,"" desserts and drinking snacks. Laab neuh gae features delicious ground lamb tossed with pickled onion, lime, and fish sauce, while a banana blossom salad with rotisserie chicken and buttery cashew nuts arrives in an appetizing coconut dressing. For an epic end, go for grilled pork jowl, topped with watermelon radish, salted duck yolk, and a shake of sawtooth herb.

The main space feels more bar than dining room, with intentionally scruffy walls decorated with distressed mirrors. Service is friendly and a young crowd keeps things lively. Cocktails are Asian-inspired while the menu uses Italy as its muse. Delicate gnudi arrive in a rustic bowl of tender lamb ragù topped with a dollop of smoked ricotta.

At Café Altro Paradiso, a buzzing bar and inviting dining room help set the scene; but the real draw is Mattos' honest, straightforward and delicious Italian cooking. Kick things off with a wildly fresh crudo dressed with olive oil, caper berry slivers, parsley and a squeeze of lemon; or a bright fennel salad with Castelvetrano olives and diced provolone.

Picture retro furniture, potted palms, and plenty of cozy nooks to relax in. The food is simple but sophisticated for the neighborhood, offering a lovely American slant on bistro fare. Even the concessions downstairs are worth perusing for their unusual selection. The menu is brief but tempting, with small plates of steak tartare, fluke crudo and burrata getting play next to classic salads (think Waldorf and kale Caesars), as well as pleasing entrées like roasted chicken, steak frites and brown butter trout.

It's an intimate, narrow room with a discernible sense of time and place. The dishes are designed for sharing although that's more than you can say for the tables-their size means you'll need to do some juggling or fairly rapid distributing to make room.

The first floor's marble-topped bar beckons for small bites and a glass of wine, while nooks beneath those low stone ceilings in the downstairs dining room call for a romantic evening over candlelight. Crafted by Frank DeCarlo, the same chef/owner of Peasant in NoLita, Bacaro's menu highlights the best of Venetian cuisine.

			There's nothing like a discreet entrance to raise expectations-and Hirohisa is nicely concealed on Thompson Street. When you do find it, you enter into a stylish, beautifully understated and meticulously laid out room that looks like a page from Wallpaper magazine. It's run with considerable charm by an unobtrusive and very courteous Japanese team. The two-page menu is easy to decipher with clear headings. However, you might just be better off giving in and letting the chefs decide by going for the balanced and seasonal dishes from the seven- or nine-course omakase. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the technical skills of the chefs considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative. Standouts include the lingering, complex flavors of Kumamoto oysters wrapped in Wagyu beef carpaccio topped with Maine sea urchin, perfectly grilled Japanese kinki, and anything with their homemade tofu. There are tables available, but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter and engage with the smiling chefs-this way, you may even find that there are a few more dishes in their repertoire than they advertise.

			New Zealander Matt Lambert appears to be on a mission to debunk some stereotypes and defy a few expectations about his homeland. For a chef raised in a country famous for its wild, rugged terrain and obsession with rugby, his contemporary cuisine is surprisingly subtle, thoughtful and at times even quite delicate-and if you come here expecting to find lamb on the menu, you'll probably be disappointed. It is obvious that this is a kitchen with a mastery of all the modern culinary techniques. Don't go thinking this is all about presentation though, because the dishes really do deliver on flavor and are ridiculously easy to eat. Nothing demonstrates the ability here more than the succulent New Zealand venison accompanied by ""flavors of gin"" which are dots of juniper meringue, fennel, and a licorice-infused sauce. Even that antipodean classic, the pavlova, is given a new lease of life by not so much being deconstructed as being reinvented, as a subtle and delicious delicacy made with passion fruit. The warm and inviting room fits seamlessly into the neighborhood and comes with a 20-foot walnut timbered bar and lime-washed exposed brick walls.

			Don't mind the manga posters or the menu's colorful cartoons-this is a serious destination for all things soba. The room is cramped and the furniture flimsy, yet a seat at the counter facing the open kitchen promises excellent cold, warm, and dip soba noodles. Service underwhelms and the scene is quirky, but the focus here is solely on the noodles and noodles alone. Curry dip soba arrives as a shallow bamboo basket of firm, chilled noodles just as a heavily spiced sauce with pork, ginger, and green onion bubbles away in a clay pot set atop a small flame. Dunk these strands of cold soba into the hot broth and let the slurping begin. Then rest assured that when you're done, the curry is fortified with hot soba water to form a delicious and drinkable soup.

			Chef/owner Giacomo Romano defines this brilliant little restaurant as an alimentaria-a place where patrons can find ever-changing temptations day or night. This may mean hearty ribollita for lunch or satisfying pasta for dinner. The sunny space is a former antique store that fashions a raw look through whitewashed brick walls and blonde wood tables. Simple, unpretentious food is the signature here, in dishes like insalata di carota, mixing sweet roasted carrots, peppery arugula, and pumpkin seeds-grab wedges of bread to soak up its citrusy vinaigrette. Fresh pasta is a must, especially the strisce alla Chiantigiana tossed with a reduction of wine, guanciale, and red onions. End with a perfect espresso or rich and oozing molten chocolate cake.

			Heat-seeking foodies on the hunt for the next big thing have found it at this chic bistro from the owners of Pearl & Ash. The dining room is as dim as a cave-its palette of concrete and ebony brightened only by a white marble bar and gracious team of servers who know when they're needed and seem to disappear when they're not. Rebelle has an edgy vibe-the space was once a burlesque bar, after all. But, beneath that veneer is impressive talent delivered with a sexy French accent. While Chef Daniel Eddy's streamlined presentations and foam flourishes have contemporary flair, rest assured that classic technique is at the root of every dish. Lamb tartare is perfectly balanced, boasting piment d'Espelette-kissed cubes of meat tossed with green chickpeas, strained yogurt, and a slice of excellent toasted bread. Then, exceptionally tender pork loin is served over a mustard-tinged sauce with wilted greens, grilled spring onions, and a delicious bite of deep-fried headcheese. For dessert, gâteau Saint-Honoré is seasonally reimagined as crisp layers of pâte feuilletée, mascarpone pastry cream, and fragrant wild strawberries adorned with tiny strawberry- caramel-lacquered profiteroles.

The cuisine is not only as attractive as the setting, but sophisticated flavors ensure its success. Kohlrabi bisque is deliciously creamy, with ambitious garnishes like smoked cabbage, pickled mustard seeds, and bits of intensely rich lamb belly to make it savory and very memorable. Straightforward skill is clear in the scored curls of squid served with a refreshing salsa verde, embellished with oroblanco. Every flavor is perfectly complementary in the dense and buttery hazelnut financier, from the chewy caramelized edges to the quenelles of lemon yogurt sorbet and pear purée. A moderately priced list showcases unique and interesting French wines.

			Whether you're here to pick at a salad or up your intake of carbs, Jean-Georges' slick restaurant within the Mercer Hotel has something for you. It has been an inexorable part of the SoHo scene for almost two decades, and ergo, knows what its customers want and how to keep them coming back. Those customers are quite an international bunch and the restaurant provides them with stylish surroundings and a healthy dose of glamour. The occasional sighting of someone from the sunny side of Celebrity Street helps too. The extensive menu is an appealing document, with everything from hot dogs to pizza, seafood platters to roast chicken. Servings are reassuringly generous yet the kitchen has a commendably light touch-try the wonderful Peekytoe crab fritters.

			It's the nature of all great cities to constantly change but that doesn't mean severing ties to the past. Raoul's has been around since the '70s-which alone qualifies it as an ""institution""-but this is no museum piece living on past glories. Wander in on any given night and you'll see a crowd of all ages united in their fondness for French food and their ability to enjoy themselves. The menu wouldn't necessarily entice the passer-by on content alone but the kitchen has a surprisingly delicate touch that raises dishes above the ordinary, whether that's tender octopus with chickpea purée or succulent rack of lamb with oyster mushrooms.

			Thanks to its enviable location and stunning skyline vistas, this waterside favorite more than lives up to its reputation as one of the dreamiest escapes in town. Delicate details like fresh, fragrant flowers, beautifully set tables, and cozy rattan chairs make for romantic environs-and though the tight space has a way of turning intimate whispers into public displays of affection, all will be forgiven after a bite or two of Chef Brad Steelman's solid-as-ever cuisine. Launch into plump wild shrimp smothered in creamy Hollandaise and served with crunchy white asparagus for added texture; or the perfectly crisped crab cake arranged with creamy uni, avocado, and a light herb salad. Pearly white halibut with roasted maitakes is a testament to the kitchen's focus on simplicity and supreme freshness, while a glistening rack of mint- and mustard seed-glazed lamb-charred on the outside with an evenly pink interior-exemplifies its artistry.

			While other restaurants may copy one another right down to the linens, Public continues to chart its own course. The industrial décor may seem like a familiar trend in SoHo where nothing is cooler than a converted loading dock, but know that this was the original factory-cum-dining room design, complete with exposed brick and gunmetal gray stools. Yet there is undeniable warmth here, and not just from the attentive and friendly servers. Note the unique bronze mailboxes, where box-holders are delivered artisanal wines hand-selected by the chef, and private rooms contoured with billowing fabrics. Asian and Mediterranean flavors weave together in an à la carte menu that is best described as inspired globetrotting. Start with a smooth Thai pumpkin soup that reflects the region in nothing more than name, yet is a deeply satisfying bowl redolent of coconut milk and curry paste. The accompanying ""larb"" of jicama, pickled chili, and crisped garlic finishes the dish with a clever deconstruction of flavors. Braised Australian lamb intensifies its accent with wondrously dark and savory Vegemite sauce. A first-come, first-serve ""Sunday Supper"" is offered every Sunday with limited seating, and often sells out.

Expats plus locals are de rigueur here, and routinely stop in for incredibly delicious and unbelievably hearty eats. Co-chef and owner Erwin Schrottner (who hails from outside Graz) keeps everything authentic, from house-made bratwurst platters to the mustard sour cream.

			Only a discretely marked door and tiny glass windows mark the entrance to this beloved sushi bijou. Once inside, you'll find a deeply elegant scene highlighting sloped bamboo slats that frame a row of beautifully plated, close-knit tables. There's a gorgeous blonde wood sushi bar in the back, while gentle jazz music plays in the background. The overall effect is very appealing and particularly serene. Service is excellent and begins at the door, with the reserved host carefully attending to your belongings. The waiters have an eagle eye for detail, managing to be so polite and unobtrusive that you're able to enjoy intimate conversation. You can choose a fixed price omakase and leave it all up to the talented Chef Shimao Ishikawa. Either way, you're in for a culinary treat. The quality and seriousness of the kitchen remains excellent with each passing year, turning out exquisite dishes like seasonal lobster sashimi (so fresh it may still be squirming on the plate) laced with ponzu-its head and innards later presented in a savory miso soup. The sashimi that follows is equally astounding, from the impeccable slicing technique to the fish quality, much of it seasonal and flown in directly from Japan.

Black and white checkerboard flooring, blackboard wall tiles bearing white ants, and a very cool giant ant mural reinforce the theme. The menu is an unrestricted look at Mexican cuisine. It is only fitting that specialties here include the Climbing Ant cocktail combining tequila, Aperol, and mole bitters; freshly-mashed guacamole seasoned with crushed ant salt; and grasshopper-crusted shrimp tacos. Insect-free creations are just as appealing, as in tacos stuffing tender masa tortillas with large chunks of battered and fried cod cheek, aïoli, and cabbage-mango slaw.

			Nestled smack in the middle of the Lower East Side's nightlife hub, this stylish Japanese gastro lounge is a must-do for the adventurous eater. SakaMai's wheelhouse is transforming highbrow ingredients (maybe foie gras, Wagyu beef, luscious uni and caviar) into delicious small plates that pair exceptionally with their formidable Japanese liquor and sake list. The menu is arranged into a collection of interesting, izakaya-style, shared plates, but there is a $65 tasting menu available as well for those with serious appetites. Dishes often blend Japanese technique with non-traditional ingredients like radicchio or parmesan. Don't miss the yakisaba-box-pressed nigiri topped with smoky, grilled mackerel, crispy lardo Ibérico, and scallions.

			With only a few years on the downtown circuit, this chic charmer is already a bonafide Village sweetheart. Brought to you by the team behind the wildly popular Emporio and Aurora, Baker & Co. is housed in the beloved and much-missed Zito & Sons Bakery-and the interior features a long, welcoming bar, cozy, wood-lined banquettes, as well as a vibrant red-and-white mosaic floor. The kitchen smartly relies on the same formula that put their other outposts on the map: honest, unfussy Italian rendered with a deft hand and deep attention to ingredients. Consider the luscious burrata, paired with pencil-thin roasted asparagus, cured fish roe and a drizzle of salsa verde; or the tender branzino with asparagus, toasted hazelnuts, arugula and chili flakes.

			Despite being named for an 18th century Italian cookbook, this buzzy trattoria is a contemporary hit. A downtown vibe courses throughout the swanky den that is slightly rustic and industrial-this setting is worth dressing up for. Half of the room is devoted to the bar, and the private dining room is best suited to exhibitionists who enjoy dining within glass walls in the center of the room. Bright flavors and skilled creativity combine in their tailored selection of Italian plates designed for grazing. Start with dishes like fried green tomatoes capped with sweet basil pesto and milky mozzarella, or fresh agnolotti stuffed with sweetbreads. Finish with a wedge of moist olive oil cake sweetened with crème fraîche and Vin Santo-soaked raisins.

This is largely thanks to Chef/owner Melissa Fox, who can be seen in the open kitchen or checking on guests in the snug space, filled with Mexican tiles, wide plank floors, and a warming fireplace. Be sure to begin any meal with a selection of empanadas, as in pulled pork with caramelized onion, chorizo and aged manchego, or the outstanding carne enchorizada (seasoned ground beef with onions, tomatoes, yucca, chayote, and potatoes).

			The origin of this very New York bistro begins with brothers Eric and Bruce Bromberg discovering an abandoned brick oven in the basement of a bodega. This sparked the idea for a bakery, and in 1998 Blue Ribbon Bakery joined the duo's restaurant family. The sunny corner location is an inviting space, from the creaky wood-plank flooring to the heady aroma of freshly baked bread downstairs. Seats at the bar are a hot commodity for solo diners. Opt for a dish that showcases the bakery's bread, such as the beef marrow with bacon bread and onion marmalade, a decadent appetizer that is just the right amount of sweet, salty, tart, and rich. Fried chicken with silky mashed potatoes and the matzoh ball soup both show Blue Ribbon's skill with comforting classics.

The cooking here is a delicious break from tradition, thanks to ramen that ranges in toppings from avocado to the richest slice of pork belly on this side of the Pacific. Of course, all of these garnishes depend on the broth-the spicy miso ramen is made with chicken and bonito, wafting with aromas that are at once spicy, savory, and sweet. These thick ribbons of noodles have a springy, bouncy texture that is never lost within the mounds of bean sprouts, scallions, soft-boiled egg, and much more. Other highlights include a crunchy hijiki salad and piping-hot batons of deep purple sweet potato tempura.

			With nostalgia at the forefront, Carbone is plain gorgeous. While this big, bold, and beautiful ode to Italian-Americana comes alive at night under the low lights, lunch is equally admired among brash bankers with big appetites and Valentino-donning divas. That same sense of history pervades the entire space, which highlights plush banquettes, impressive ceramics, and glittering chandeliers. Was the striking tiled-floor inspired from a certain restaurant scene in The Godfather? Probably. Mid-century classics are what this menu is all about, but exalted ingredients, skill, and presentations will excite even the most cynical savant. Stylish servers-who work the floor with a little flirt and lot of flair-remain in character while presenting top antipasti like crusty garlic bread, soppressata, and fresh, particularly divine olive oil-dunked mozzarella. A Caesar salad tossed tableside with carb-worthy croutons and gently pickled white anchovies hits the ball out of the park, while pale-yellow, ricotta-filled tortellini over an intensely rich and meaty ragù is a laudable delight.

			If you forget about your bank statement, don't arrive faint with hunger, and leave your cynicism at the door-you'll love ZZ's Clam Bar. With just four marble tables and a small counter, this is as intimate as it gets. But you first have to navigate the bouncer at the door who'll only allow admittance with a reservation. This at least ensures that, when you're inside this bijou spot, the door doesn't swing open every minute. Once in, you're handed a cocktail list-these are, without doubt, some of the best in town and fully justify the lofty prices. The short seafood menu comes with a couple of choices under headings like ""crudo,"" ""seared"" and ""ceviche."" Before you do anything else, order the trout roe on toast-it's a beautiful thing and will linger long in the memory. This is not the place for everyone. Some won't see past some of the more pretentious elements and affectations and the prices can be eye-watering-the Chianina beef carpaccio comes in at over $100. However, judicious ordering before you plunge into the cocktails, like having clams instead of caviar, can at least keep your final bill from escalating too wildly. It also helps that the place is run with considerable charm, patience and care.

			The eatery formerly known as Five Points has been reinvented as an Italian-leaning restaurant complete with exposed brick walls and the requisite red pizza oven. Though the dining room is bright and airy, a notable bar program-especially in Italian inflections such as homemade limoncello-prove there's more to this joint than meets the eye. The best bites are unfussy updates of familiar dishes, such as rye rigatoni with rich braised lamb, fragrant torn oregano, and a sprinkling of sharp cheese. A silky, satisfying nest of cacio e pepe is heavy on the black pepper and nutty pecorino, and that red pizza oven produces thin, crisp pies topped with tomato, basil, and sharp pecorino. For dessert, a bomboloni of ricotta and chocolate is worth the splurge.

			While this circa 1937 setting has been restored and refreshed, nothing here changes and that is its beauty. This quintessential New York tavern is still surrounded by dark wood, checkerboard tiled floors, and those framed caricatures. The astute service team handles the crowds and energy as well as ever-they even don the same white-aproned livery seen in Mad Men. It's that kind of place. The menu's dedication to bistro classics (like oxtail and foie gras terrine) and New York steakhouse fare ensure its longevity. Trust them to prepare a steak tartare that is beyond textbook perfect, comprised here of pristine beef tenderloin, anchovy, capers and more, crowned with a tiny quail's egg. This kitchen has a way with meat that goes far beyond the burger on everyone's lips, thanks to beef that promises the deep, telltale flavors of dry-aging. Their massive pork chops draped in sauce charcutière have an intense crust that is blackened but never burnt, concealing a juicy interior that is no small feat for such a large piece of meat. The bittersweet chocolate soufflé is, was, and probably always will be crowd-pleasing and delicious, especially when served with a melting scoop of Bourbon-pecan ice cream.

			It's hard to tell from the name, but this delightful retreat has a distinctly polished, upscale and intimate sensibility. A simple glow from the window in the evening hints at the treats to come. Then make your way inside, and you'll find a gorgeous interior with a few communal tables, a marble-topped bar, as well as cozy two-tops.

So yes, you'll be talking about the splendid décor, but rest assured as it won't be long before the first-rate food and graceful service catches your attention. Chris Cipollone is an accomplished chef, and his food is a marriage of equals between Italian and Asian. The result is sublime, refined and innovative fare. Dinner must begin with hot, pillowy monkey bread served in a cast iron pot, dusted with sea salt and served with rosemary-scented lardo as well as roasted seaweed butter.

			Beyond this quaint and charming façade lies one of Little Italy's famed mainstays, ever-popular with dreamy eyed dates seeking the stuff of Billy Joel lyrics. The expansive space does indeed suggest a nostalgic romance, with its series of Mediterranean-themed rooms, though the most celebrated is the pleasant garden atrium (il cortile is Italian for courtyard), with a glass-paneled ceiling and abundant greenery. A skilled line of chefs present a wide array of familiar starters and entrées, from eggplant rollatini to chicken Francese; as well as a range of pastas, such as spaghettini puttanesca or risotto con funghi. Several decades of sharing family recipes and bringing men to one bent knee continues to earn Il Cortile a longtime following.

Proffering some of the best Malaysian treats in town, including all the classics, New Malaysia sees a deluge of regulars who pour in for a massive offering of exceptional dishes. Round tables cram a room furnished with little more than a service counter. Still, the aromas wafting from flaky roti canai and Melaka crispy coconut shrimp keep you focused on the food. Capturing the essence of this region are brusque servers who speedily deliver abundant and authentic bowls of spicy-sour asam laksa fragrant with lemongrass; kang-kung belacan, greens with dried shrimp and chili; and nasi lemak, the national treasure starring coconut rice, chicken curry, and dried anchovies.

			This wildly popular dim sum joint is still packed to the gills most days, and for good reason: the Cantonese fare and dim sum served up at this bright, contemporary spot is as good as the food you'll find trekking out to those super-authentic places in far-flung Queens. Even better, they take reservations-and dim sum orders are taken by the staff as opposed to rolled around on the traditional cart, helping ensure the food stays super fresh. If the price seems a bit higher than its competitors, you'll find it's worth it for dishes like sweet shrimp, rolled in rice paper and laced with dark soy sauce; plump snow pea leaf dumplings spiked with vibrant ginger and garlic; rich, tender duck dumplings; or an irresistibly flaky baked roast pork pie.

Come for lunch at Babbo, for example, and there'll be Stan Getz playing gently in the background to accompany the quiet clinking of cutlery and the soft murmur of conversation.

			Chef Dan Barber's iconic venue remains the paragon of farm-to-table dining in Manhattan by virtue of its seasonal lineup of pampered product. Everything on the menu is sourced from the Stone Barns Center (home to Blue Hill's Westchester farm) as well as a number of local producers. Blue Hill's intimate space has been hosting a devoted foodie following for an impressive 15-some years, and service in this former speakeasy-where fresh flowers and candlelight cast a romantic spell-is nothing less than excellent. The adept kitchen turns out contemporary cuisine, which in turn showcases the astounding quality stocked in the larder and allows vegetables to shine at all times. Asparagus spears are gently roasted to preserve their natural earthiness and coupled with vibrant beet yogurt, as well as stinging nettles cream for a perfect balance in flavor. Then, moist striped bass draped atop fennel purée is decked with soft, sweet currants and toasted salty pine nuts to form a succulent and satisfying entrée.

The duck is deftly carved and dramatically served by the chef himself, so push in your chair and prepare for a festive DIY feast of warm, soft pancakes, cool cucumbers, scallions, and sweet hoisin. Although the duck is what makes this a destination, there are several other entrées like sizzling sliced beef with scallops; and live lobster with ginger and scallions. To begin, the clear golden broth of the duck wonton soup is an appropriate prelude to the main event.

			Building Tamarind cost a cool five million, and it shows-every inch of this soaring space oozes with grandeur. With its classic TriBeCa edifice and gorgeous marble bar (an ideal perch for post-work indulgence), the glass-fronted behemoth draws a posh crowd of Wall Streeters and well-heeled locals. Most impressive of all is the sleek display kitchen, outfitted with a gleaming tandoor that turns out exceptional Mughlai food like nawab shami kabab (lamb patties seasoned with ginger) and hara bhara kabab (pearl-white paneer mingled with bright emerald-green spinach). While service is mediocre at best and the kitchen may fall behind at peak times, mains like kolambi pola (prawns in a coconut-and-chili curry) make up for any gaffes and guarantee a return visit.

			Cool, chic, and completely urbane, Jungsik is the epitome of contemporary elegance. Inside the large, neatly partitioned space, find rich browns and ivory furnishings with flattering lighting that is just bright enough to see your food clearly. The chairs are deep and tables are well spaced, but request a plush corner banquette for maximum comfort. Even the place settings show sculptural beauty through dark pottery and white porcelain. The ambience is fairly quiet and somewhat reflective. The modern cuisine is confident, complex, and happens to be leaning much more toward Europe than Korea of late. No matter-the cooking remains profoundly enjoyable. At the same time, the most inspired dishes are the ones that retain their heritage, as in the dome of seaweed-seasoned rice with cubes of smoked and torched yellowtail, finished with slivered lettuce. Before the crispy red snapper arrives at the table, hot oil is poured overtop to cook the fish but also to yield incredibly crisped skin, served with a brunoise of hearty greens and potatoes and rich perilla vinaigrette. Artful desserts include black raspberry and coconut sorbet with crumbles of spinach cake, yuzu meringue, and perfect berry slices.

			239 West Broadway will be a familiar address to those who know their restaurants as it has hosted a number of seminal establishments over the years-namely Montrachet and Corton. Drew Nieporent's Bâtard restaurant is now firmly in situ and once again we have a talented chef making waves in TriBeCa. Chef Markus Glocker's cooking is very precise and his dishes look quite delicate on the plate. But like a good featherweight they pack more of a punch than you're expecting. You'll even notice his Austrian roots in evidence in some of the dishes, such as short rib and tafelspitz terrine, or the Granny Smith and sweetbread strudel. The room is comfortable and neat and the atmosphere grown-up yet animated. When it comes to service though, it appears that the restaurant has mistaken informality for indifference as it lacks coordination or direction. So you may need to remind yourself that you're here primarily for the food. But that food is very good indeed.

			Tucked within the sprawling French markets of Le District, L'Appart is not so much a dining room as the crown jewel comprised of everything those surrounding boulangeries, cheese markets, and butchers can offer. Through two nondescript doors and a small brass plate etched with its Liberty Street address, find an impeccably decorated interior that resembles an elegant Parisian apartment (hence the abbreviated name). Stunning New York Harbor views wake you from that reverie. Chef Nicolas Abello starts meals on a high note with canapés simply called ""Nico's snacks"" that range from a cool, fragrant Charentais melon soup with a hint of mulling spices, to a spoonful of smoky eggplant topped with the perfect counterpoint of sweet, dense prawn. This may be the prelude to a picturesque ensemble of foie gras with mango purée, pickled Finger grapes, green gooseberries, pecan slices, and more. Herb-crusted Colorado lamb filet is downright flawless, accompanied by a copper pot of confit byaldi, layering thin slices of baked vegetables and served with a wonderfully salty goat cheese ""samosa.""

			Chef/owner Marc Murphy's Landmarc is the TriBeCa destination for meeting friends over casual drinks and food that happens to be rib-sticking delicious. Downstairs, the bi-level space showcases thick steel cables suspending industrial art and a horseshoe bar flanking a large cooking fire that warms the soul and sizzles those lamb chops. The upstairs is more serene. Meals may start with lighter plates of smoky and blistered shishito peppers flecked with crunchy sea salt. Then, move on to deeply satisfying (and reasonably priced) nightly pasta specials, like thick and buttery spaghetti alla Bolognese. ""Landmarc classic"" cheese plates are a reliable highlight. Miniature desserts mean that there is always room for a lemon-custard tart (or four).

Unlike many Japanese restaurants with one specialty, this izakaya's diverse menu includes bar snacks, sushi, steamed buns, and ramen.

The food is worth braving the wait and decibel levels, so sip a craft brew or cocktail before digging in.

The setting is so rich with character that one could simply be satisfied by Tiny's fine burger, featuring dry-aged rib-eye and a side of cheddar tater tots.

			Such a high number of staff per guest might make one wonder if some are just there to dance along to the meal-and they kind of are. The mood is fun yet remains professional, and in fact quite a thrill if you're really into Bon Jovi. Yet the open kitchen's performance is far more engaging, as the numerous cooks coax each dish to perfection. The whole team is actually working as one to ensure the high quality and thorough enjoyment of your meal. Start with an extraordinary salvo, such as a thin, warm waffle filled with cheddar cream cheese and generous slices of summer truffles from Provence. Follow that with foie gras custard and corn foam in a dense, aromatic lemon verbena broth. Those excellent broths and juices appear throughout the meal, whether green tomato-based to accompany scallops with horseradish powder and green apple, or as aromatic yuzu, green almonds, and celeriac paired with delicately poached lobster and brown butter. Desserts can be a beautiful and awesome finish, especially the rhubarb sorbet with chocolate ganache and hazelnut cream over a bed of crumbled shortbread.

Of course, the elegant room has a great deal more to offer thanks to an impressive Bizen-yaki tile wall, well-spaced seats along the blonde wood counter, and hand-painted crystal sake glasses. But that perfectly seasoned rice and fish (some of it wild-caught from Japan) are the foundations this omakase, showcasing nigiri presented at a leisurely pace so guests can savor each bite. When your itamae presents those beautifully scored and deliciously pungent Hokkaido sardines, the finely sliced chives, grated daikon, bead of wasabi, and brush of soy sauce that garnish it make every flavor delicate and memorable. Slices of poached monkfish liver are velvety, ultra-rich, and prove that these chefs are at the top of their game. Bonito is gently cold-smoked and infused with flavor yet maintains the texture of fish in its ""raw"" state, further enhanced by soy-sesame-chive sauce. No element of tradition is forgotten here: when your chef and servers offer you a deep bow upon your departure, they will hold it until you are down the street and out of sight.

			Colors evoke the Caribbean at Marcha, a narrow restaurant known for authentic Spanish tapas. A long bar dominates the sea-blue and sunny-yellow room filled with high tables and a convivial crowd. The music is a touch loud, the service is refreshingly down-to-earth, and the food impresses beyond what its neighborhood bar-vibe might suggest. The menu is broad and affordable, which makes a perfect excuse to sample widely. Staples from tender tortilla Espanola to gambas al ajillo are delicious executions of classic tapas. Ribbons of luscious Spanish ham are on handsome display in the hongos e higos coca, a chewy flatbread also topped with mushrooms, figs, and buttery almonds. It would be blasphemy to skip the dates wrapped in bacon or the thick-cut yucca fries.

Natural light floods the walls, which showcase an impressive collection of ancient warrior gear, all beautifully framed as if museum-ready. Menu descriptions are minimal but the staff is happy to elaborate. Excellent technique shines through the Taiwanese specialties, notably in strips of ""shredded beef"" sautéed in a dark, meaty paste, and tossed with dried tofu that balances complex flavors with fresh Chinese celery-a hands down winner on the menu. Likewise, the stir-fry of wonderfully briny clams and basil offers a perfect balance of sweet and salty flavors with oyster sauce, soy, rice wine, and red chilies.

There, wood beams and slats, swirling ceiling fans, and oxblood leather booths fashion a comfortable-and quieter-setting. The scent of wood smoke wafting through the red brick structure (which coincidentally once served as a meatpacking warehouse) only heightens the diners' carnivorous cravings. Minimize decision-making and order the Extreme Sampler: a heaping feast of apple cider-brined smoked chicken, dry-rubbed slow-smoked pork ribs, and lean Creekstone Farms brisket. Add on a creative side or two-perhaps the barbecue fried rice studded with bits of pulled pork?

			What this sweet little Mexican spot lacks in looks it makes up for in personality-plus a warm, inviting atmosphere that draws a constant stream of locals. Behind the counter, a smiling staff prepares each order with machine gun speed, and professional servers are quick to help anyone not fluent in Spanish. Daily specials could include anything from a complex mole to slow-braised goat with broth, though the menu is rife with options. Begin with a torta, stuffed with steak, layers of beans, avocado, onions, lettuce, and a bright chipotle mayo. In the molcajetes, grilled cactus strips, Mexican sausage, and tortillas are sautéed and then buried under a spicy green sauce and sprinkled with queso. A nice end is found in a cool disk of coconut flan.

But really, everyone's eyes are drawn to the piles of food, sopas, and counters laden with freshly made cakes sold by the slice. While pernil rules in this borough-and Brisas indeed offers a great version-this kitchen's forte is Dominican food. In fact, find large families and groups of locals enjoying copious amounts of hot, tasty, and ridiculously affordable specialties. Start with a hearty treat like sancocho, or go for relleno de papa, deep-fried mashed potatoes stuffed with cheese and ground meat. Then dive into a helping of the patitas de cerdo, a stew of pig's feet with cassava, potatoes, herbs, and strips of tripe.

			Decked out with crimson walls and red checkered tablecloths, this is the kind of place where diners feel like they're in on a delicious secret-and that's no coincidence, as Tra Di Noi is Italian for ""between us."" Responsible for the success behind this tiny spot is Chef/owner Marco Coletta, who directs the front and back of house with the precision of an air traffic controller and the passion of an Italian nonno. This sincerity shines through in the cooking, from the ethereally light gnocchi di patate in a rich lamb ragù to the quickly pan-fried fillet of sole Francese nestled in a creamy lemon sauce with shrimp, parsley, and white wine. Only a few desserts are on offer, and all are made in house. For a classic finale, go with the ricotta cheesecake.

Specializing in Bukharian (Central Asian) cuisine, longstanding Cheburechnaya has been a neighborhood pioneer. The focused menu is more engrossing than the décor, and it's easy to want every cumin- and paprika-laced item on it. Bring your own vodka and start with the house specialty, chebureki, an empanada-like deep-fried wrap stuffed with either hand-cut lamb seasoned with cumin, chili, cilantro, and paprika; or fennel-sparked cabbage.

			All you really need to know is that this is the hands-down best ramen above 59th Street. Sure, decorative elements are simple, and it hardly matters that this gem is hidden behind the 125th Street station's brick escalator. What comes from the kitchen however deserves kudos.

Shio, shoyu, and miso ramen are all delightful, but the tonkatsu ramen is a special treat.

			For truly amazing sushi, head to the heart of Harlem, where Chef Shinichi Inoue-formerly of Sushi Azabu-now presides over this discreet and unexpected addition to the neighborhood. Inside the small establishment, bamboo blinds obscuring the scene outside combined with hushed and genuine hospitality produce a sense of calm and refinement. The Nagasaki-born chef works behind a display of sparkling fillets and a dark counter arranged with 14 washi placemats and sets of lacquer chopsticks. It is here that a concise list of omakase options is prepared increasing in price with the additions of tempura, sashimi and an uni tasting. Chef Inoue personally looks after every detail of the meal-from the blended soy sauce to the house miso recipe. Pickled ginger placed on your tray ushers in the expertly crafted nigiri, and while the grated wasabi root that sparks most pieces can be a bit aggressive at times, the procession is rather delightful. Highlights include a buttery bite of shima aji from Kyushu island; shiro ika dressed with salt and sudachi; soy-marinated tuna with mustard and toasted sesame seeds; and fatty tuna from Boston-one of the rare pieces not found in Japanese waters.

Join in the celebratory mood and make some new friends (no one really dines alone here) while tucking into tender ribbons of savory fettuccini Alfredo; succulent veal pizzaiola laced with a delectable marinara; or top it all off with a cannoli freshly piped with ricotta and studded with candied fruit. The irresistible desserts are wheeled around to guests on a rolling tray, of course.

			Deep in the heart of Brooklyn bordering Bath Beach, Mtskheta Café pumps out Georgian classics in a green-hued, faux-brick dining room complete with paper napkins, a campy jungle mural, and television looping foreign music videos. While the décor may lack, the service and food excel, setting this impossible-to-pronounce restaurant apart from the nearby bodegas and elevated subway tracks. Whether or not you can deduce what's on the Cyrillic menu, friendly servers stand by, directing guests to native dishes like badrijani, an almost overwhelming helping of eggplant stuffed with fluffy walnut purée. It's light compared to the mutton bozbashi, though-a heady soup of tarragon, cilantro and lamb fat that adds a layer to any blustery day.

A wood-fired pizza oven is in back, while the front offers sidewalk seating under a protective awning. Attractive shelving lined with canned tomatoes frames the bar area and dining room. The menu offers Italian favorites, executed with a deft hand and solid ingredients. Pizzas are 12-inches and come rosso or bianco, topped with the likes of vodka sauce, wild mushrooms, or charred vegetables. Excellent pastas, like the penne Caprese, are tossed with tomato sauce, fresh basil, and creamy mozzarella. A neatly deboned branzino arrives subtly flavored with fresh herbs and beautifully seasoned, alongside wilted spinach and a wedge of lemon.

The décor is outdated, but white tablecloths are clean and crisp, and glasses gleam at the prospect of great wine varietals. With a trio of pasta, you needn't choose between fusi swirled in a grappa- mushroom- and Grana-sauce; squid ink taglierini; or maltagliati in a roasted tomato and basil sauce with a touch of cream.

Chicharon bulaklak and accompanying house-made suka (coconut-sugarcane vinegar steeped with bird chilies) lends quite the kick to fried chicken skin.

			All the locals love Vida, where popular Chef/owner Silva Popaz has created a cozy little restaurant with a firm commitment to simple, but well-executed, dishes. Inside the café-like atmosphere, you'll find unique artwork lining brightly painted walls, and a smattering of tables surrounding a long communal wood table in the center. The charming Popaz travels quite often, and the flavors she picks up along her journeys tend to make their way back into her menu at Vida. The ""Mexican Duo""-her most popular dish-features pulled pork- and chicken-stuffed tortillas, topped with a vibrant Chimayo chile and tangy cheese sauce, and paired with tender stewed beans sporting bright green onion; while a delicate bread pudding arrives puddled in creamy vanilla ice cream.

			Chef Marcus Samuelsson's latest Harlem hot spot is a funky corner devoted to slow-roasted chicken and old-school street-style. Wade through the boisterous, rum punch-fueled crowd and enter this party to find splashes of custom graffiti, eye-popping murals, and lighting fixtures made from cassette tapes, drum sets, and bicycle tires. Despite all this sensory overload, it is impossible not to notice the plump, auburn birds spinning in the glass-fronted oven. Tender, juicy, and exceptionally flavorful, they steal the show and are supported by the chef's signature mash-up of global flavors: green papaya salad, jasmine fried rice, and cornbread. Not feeling the poultry? Opt for the spicy piri-piri catfish with crispy shallots and avocado.

			Despite its less-than-impressive strip mall surroundings, this Thai kitchen-a haven of soft pink walls and cordial servers-is nothing short of wonderful. Bypass the small selection of snacks available for purchase, and instead settle in to a table to peruse the menu and prepare for the aromatic and savory feast ahead. Begin with the som tum Lao-style, a traditional green papaya salad made less so with the stimulating addition of salty anchovies. Then crispy pork may top the pick-your-protein options for noodles and entrées. Additionally, those deep-fried bits of pork belly are a treat when thrown into creamy red chili- and coconut-based chu chee curry. And as an ideal accompaniment to any of the curries, look no further than the salted fish fried rice.

			The spicy, complex, and fragrant dosas of Dosa Garden make this casual stop a thoroughly impressive hidden gem. The ambience feels more storefront eatery than sit-down restaurant, with just a few hints of South Asian décor, but the warm, made-to-order dishes and aromas from the kitchen are transporting. The kitchen boasts a tandoor oven but also churns out an array of elaborate dosas, like the tantalizingly crisp Mysore masala served with a sour yogurt sauce, spread with spicy chutney, and folded with potatoes, peppercorns, curry leaves, chili, and cumin. Don't miss the unique rasa vada, crunchy lentil doughnuts soaked in a deliciously spicy rasam. Curries are amazingly delish, like the shockingly deep brown Chettinadu fish, accented with mustard seeds.

			El Paso is an East Harlem cantina that serves some of the most gratifying south-of-the-border fare in town. True-blue residents as well as those new to this evolving neighborhood crowd its affable rooms, where margaritas, ice-cold cerveza, and smiles flow freely. Stucco walls and decorative metal work grace the interior, while the covered back patio has a breezy mien. Tacos, quesadillas, and ceviche kick off cooking that hits all the right notes. Zesty guacamole is freshly mashed and served up in a molcajete with warm tortilla chips. Bold citrus- and tequila-braised carnitas Michoacanás are kissed by green chilies and expertly paired with a bowl of hearty black beans and tender tortillas for wrapping.

The menu boasts house-made pastas like silken fettuccine treated to a soaking of Domenico sugo-a hearty amalgam of sweet fennel sausage, pan-fried spicy meatballs, and pork ragù in a bright tomato sauce. A roasted whole fish is beautifully done, expertly de-boned and dressed with a touch of salmoriglio, charred lemon and young arugula.

The design of this long and inviting room may elevate the experience, but it is their spicy and unusual cooking that makes everything shine. The menu here is a dance of sensations-tart, spicy, sour, fresh-as seen in Chinese broccoli leaves (miang kha-na) with pork, chilies, peanuts, garlic, and lime. Grilled squid (pla muek yang) has an addictive fiery sauce, while fermented pork and sticky rice sausage (sai krok Isan) is pleasurably sour with cabbage, chili, and peanuts.

In fact, Sweet Yummy House is a diamond in the rough for those hunting down authentic spice levels and Taiwanese specialties they've never heard of.

While the dark, stylish room boasts such details as pretty light fixtures and a sleek wall of mirrors, Chef Kunihide Nakajima's impressive handiwork shines even brighter than the décor. The meal may start off with a refreshing bite leading to succulent sashimi, which has featured profoundly creamy Kumamoto oysters, flash-boiled live lobster, and slivers of luminous Montauk fluke.

A few insider tips from the regulars and you're on your way: make your reservation weeks in advance, as the dining room stays quite booked; score a seat only at the sushi counter, not just to enjoy those freshly scored slices of sushi straight from the chef's hand, but also because the congenial vibe at the bar surpasses the somewhat rushed experience at the tables; and do keep an eye on those prices, which can add up quicker than a trip to Target. Sushi of Gari is Chef Masatoshi ""Gari"" Sugio's flagship restaurant, and the legendary chef's trademark creativity and skill shine in spades here. A night indulging in his omakase might include delicately seared kanpachi topped with a lightly poached quail egg; wildly fresh Japanese red snapper paired with pine nuts, bright greens, and fried lotus root; tender, seared toro with garlic and ginger sauce; or perfectly poached yellowtail, laced with sesame sauce and a sprinkle of chives.

The space may be more functional than cozy, but this staff knows how to treat their customers-from welcoming each table with a succulent assortment of banchan to happily adjusting a dish's spice level. They also clearly know the many secrets of tofu: the kitchen makes its own, on view at the front of the restaurant, then deploys it in a series of silken soondubu (soft bean curd stews). Served scalding hot in a ddukbaegi or glazed earthenware cauldron, this bubbling piquant broth contains your choice of pork, seafood, or even beef intestine-but kimchi, the funky favorite, is the hands-down winner.

			An ode to the pleasures of the pig, this is the pleasantly casual home to Sunnyside-rasied Chef/owner Daniel Yi. Dark woods, playful pig motifs, and soft lights decorate the simple space, known for its friendly, personal service. There's probably no better way to welcome diners to this aptly named bistro than with a bag of salty bacon-fat popcorn. Yet, also renowned are the bao and beer pairings that change frequently. Other options include wide strands of golden-yellow pappardelle dressed with grilled ramps, sweet peas and smoky bacon lardons. Deep-fried chicken wings coated with a garlic-infused caramel sauce and sprinkled liberally with crispy garlic chips boasts its own decadent prowess.

Orsay proves its dedication to French tradition from the sidewalk seating to marble stairs leading up to a private room. The famous cheese soufflé sustains much of the well-dressed crowd here, but the classic menu brings much more. Soupe de poisson is a richly satisfying fusion of fish, tomatoes, fennel, and herbs; brook trout is presented à la Grenobloise with browned butter, capers, and finely diced croutons; and roasted pork tenderloin arrives with savoy cabbage, apples, and hard cider sauce. The soaked baba au rhum is as fine a rendition as any à Paris.

The simple space offers three rows of tables, unadorned white walls, and a well-lit counter in the rear, and is warmed up by enthusiastic servers. Devoted customers know the draw here is not atmosphere, but the quality and excellent value omakase. Fish can be surprisingly luscious, especially the salmon, which has a remarkably clean finish and great salty note. The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course omakase might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth brimming with scallions, seaweed, and a fish cake.

Loeb Boathouse was built in 1954 and includes an outdoor bar and a restaurant whose glass wall folds away in the summer to give every table a great view of the lake. If you want to swap the chaos of the city and its cacophony of car horns for a couple of tranquil hours, then here's where to come. The menu is a mix of American and European classics alongside less successful dishes of a more innovative persuasion. Try the robustly seasoned linguine with Little Neck clams or Scottish salmon with chickpea purée. While brunch and lunch are year-long affairs, dinner is only served during warmer months.

A number of inventive items have graced the menu of late-a nod, perhaps, to Berganza's invigorated spirit.

Of course, the service is just as polished as the design. Though the kitchen bills itself as a steakhouse, you can't go wrong with the excellent raw bar, fish entrées, and unique appetizers. And while it's true that the quality of cooking has been less impressive as of late, sinfully gooey pommes aligot, dusted with cracked black pepper, are as outstanding as ever.

			A local standby that doesn't actually look like much, Sushi Seki combines exceptional sushi and sashimi with a casual vibe that keeps neighborhood loyalists packed in for late-night dinners and take-out. It may seem like a simple restaurant for a very good spicy tuna roll, but their unique omakase is what makes it a worthy favorite. Dedicated itamae bring quality and creativity to each bite. Sample toro chopped with ginger that is at once tender, rich and crunchy over rice; or a slice of fatty salmon with avocado sauce. But, for a true treat, go for their signature hand roll of toasted nori surrounding chopped juicy scallop with crunchy tempura flakes, tobiko, and spicy mayo. An expanded location in Hell's Kitchen offers an attractive array of seating options.

			There is no shortage of good looks in this part of town and Chef Michael White's bold restaurant fits in nicely. It's certainly an impressive space, dressed in neutral tones. It's also a big space, with a bar that divides two dining rooms-the one on the upper level is less formal, while the lower level room has a more animated air. The name refers to a department in France's southwest, but the cooking looks more to a typical brasserie for its influences. There is certainly a lot of choice on offer-bouillabaisse, grillades for those who like their food familiar, fruits de mer, salads and a notable selection of meat and fish. The kitchen reveals its confidence by ensuring that plates are never overcrowded. Desserts, like Paris-Brest or crème brûlée, are a highlight.

			The serene, slender, bi-level dining room that is pizzaArte stands in stark contrast to the workaday bustle outside its doors. A bar and a domed wood-burning pizza oven populate the first floor, while the upstairs is filled with closely set tables and gallery-white walls displaying original art. Expect the room to be packed with a chic, Italian-accented clientele who flock here for blissfully authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas. These are baked to perfect pliability with a bit of char, topped with mpeccable ingredients like creamy mozzarella di bufala, broccoli rabe, and sausage. Fine cooking skills are displayed in the paccheri al baccala, tossing pasta tubes with cherry tomatoes, plump Sicilian capers, intense Gaeta olives, and firm fillets of cod.

			Black-and-white portraits of people pouring streams of wine into their mouths directly from porróns-blown glass wine vessels with long, tapered spouts-give you the idea of what this spot is all about. Dark colors give a cloistered feel to the intimate space, which is a pleasant contrast to its traffic-clogged location. The kitchen churns out a graceful, all-encompassing array of tapas, large plates, and even paellas worth their 40-minute wait. Sample bites like canned esparragos blancos Navarro-their thick, tender stalks are served cool and dressed with Chardonnay vinaigrette-or bacalao a la Vizcaina, Basque-style salt cod with a sauce melding the flavors of roasted peppers, garlic, olives, and potatoes served in a bubbling hot cazuela.

			Taboon's namesake brick-walled, wood-fired oven is burning a bit brighter these days since Chef Efi Nahon has returned to Hell's Kitchen's finest Middle Eastern dining room. That oven not only provides a heartwarming welcome and sets the whitewashed interior aglow, but it is also responsible for baking the incredible plank of bread that is alone worth a trip here. Bring friends because this midtown marvel's recently revised menu is best enjoyed by grazing the list of zesty meze like house-made scallop and crab sausage shakshooka with poached quail egg, or wild mushroom bread pudding with creamy talleggio and romesco. Vegetables aren't spared the flames, as in a luscious and healthy pile of roasted broccolini splashed with orange oil.

			Sometimes we need to be served by someone older than our socks, be addressed by our name rather than as ""you guys,"" be able to converse without recourse to sign language, and to sit in a chair designed by someone familiar with the concept of upholstery. The handsomely attired Clement, at the Peninsula Hotel, provides all this and more, and is ideal for those times when we need to feed our inner grown-up. The kitchen does its bit too by avoiding spurious reinvention and instead focusses on producing wholesome, satisfying and adroitly prepared contemporary dishes. Start with a perky tuna crudo, have the wonderfully succulent milk-fed veal chop which has been given time to rest before being served, and end with pumpkin pie with silky cinnamon ice cream.

			Settled into sleek Sutton Place, Jubilee is New York City's very own version of Cheers. Affluent families are in full force here, while friends gather on weeknights to mingle over wine and fine French-Belgian cuisine. The European-inflected nautical décor screams quaint coastal elegance with perpetually packed tables and a bar where everybody knows your name. A silky, saffron-scented fish soup, accompanied by grated Gruyère, a few croûtes, and pot of rouille is deliciously classic and incredibly sumptuous. But before filling up, be sure to sample the sole meuniere-a delicate fish seared perfectly and served with sautéed spinach leaves. If that doesn't sound like the best way to end a long day, their popular crème brûlée offers the ultimate fix.

			The crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel, Jean-Georges reigns supreme over the Central Park dining scene. The restaurant's separate entrance can be something of a whirlwind as guests must pass through buzzing Nougatine to arrive at this refined silver-gray dining room. Still, those immense windows, columns, and twinkling views make it a very special place. On weekdays, the feel is formal and business-driven, while weekends hum with tourists, socialites, and an easier vibe. The highly professional staff is one well-oiled and smooth machine. To dine here for the first time is to be blown away by brilliance; to come again and again is to realize that certain elements of the cooking flaunt more of a patina than a shine. Yet even certain menu classics continue to earn new accolades, especially the ever-memorable foie gras brûlée with dried sour cherries, pistachios, white Port gelée, and a spiced fig jam that leaves you weak in the knees. Desserts venture to rise above the savory dishes in theme and harmony. Grand finales include an homage to chocolate with hazelnut chocolate mille-feuille, chocolate pudding tart, and chocolate sable. Lunch is a superb option for those who don't want to break the bank.

			Nougatine is a bright, stylish, and contemporary space on the ground floor of the Trump International Hotel-bookended by an open kitchen at one end and a huge picture window the other. What really sets it apart, however, is the service: the restaurant is run with lots of flair and no little professionalism by a vast army of servers-this is not one of the places where you need to use semaphore to get noticed by your waiter. The food is light and current and the lunch menu, with dishes taken from the main à la carte, is a positive steal-although the immaculately coiffured clientele do not seem the sort to be overly concerned by the concept of a bargain. Dishes like veal Milanese are confidently executed and it's worth leaving room for desserts, like apple tart.

			Make no mistake: Masa's adjacent lounge is by no means a bargain substitute for the stunner next door. Bar Masa remains as hopping as when it first opened, and on any given night every tightly packed seat is perpetually filled-thanks in part to a no-reservations policy. Despite the crowds, softly lit Japanese limestone walls give the room an air of serenity. The long list of creative sips are excellent, so lay your lips on a cucumber mint gimlet while eagerly awaiting selections off the extensive menu.

The kitchen puts out a tasty helping of sweet and spicy onion rings, buttermilk-battered and deep-fried in portions designed for linebackers. The beautifully marbled ribeye is aged for more than 45 days and would be delicious simply seared, though a chili rub adds an aggressive spice. Cool down with a lightly dressed purslane salad.

			To taste what may be the continent's best sushi, experience the quiet, contemplative, and very exclusive ceremony of Chef Masa Takayama's omakase. Everything here carries a certain weight, beginning with the heavy wooden door and carrying through to the bill. The room of course is as unchanging and calming as a river stone, set amid blonde hinoki wood and a gargantuan forsythia tree. Yes, you'll forget it's on the fourth floor of a mall. Attention to detail is unsurpassed and at times it may seem like a bit much, but a reverential spirit is part of your meal here. Service displays the same smooth grace, with servers at-the-ready carrying their hot towels, fingerbowls, tea, and bits of insight. Awaken the palate with a sweet chunk of hairy crab meat dressed in citrusy yuzu beneath creamy tomalley. This may be followed by the chef's signature glass coup of minced toro and a very fine-and very generous-pile of Osetra caviar. Maine uni is downright epic, served in its shell with caramelized custard and paper-thin, melting sheets of white truffle. The chef's selection of sushi is unrivaled; the rice is firm and temperate, garnishes are subtle, and quality of fish is supreme.

			There is no more dramatic departure from the soulless Time Warner Center than entering through the iconic blue doors to Per Se. An upscale sense of calm-the kind that only money can buy-soaks the atmosphere. Some might say that the ease with which one can now get a reservation here may herald the end of this certain style of fine dining, yet New York will always have a special place in its heart for Per Se, with all its bells and whistles and that incomparable park view. That said, the dining room seems more for tourists and celebrants than New Yorkers. Chef Thomas Keller continues to raise the bar with meals that express artistry and seasonality right down to the moment. This is expressed with tremendous consistency throughout both tasting menus, with a superb vegetarian option. Meat courses attain new heights with the likes of Snake River Farms calotte de boeuf, served remarkably tender within a crisp exterior, paired with a deeply flavored and memorable Bordelaise sauce, pommes Maxime and glazed pearl onions. Desserts are more contemporary than classic yet always put pleasure first, like the fluffy little orbs of strawberry and vanilla. But always save room for the chocolates. Always.

			There are some restaurants that have a discernible pulse that makes you immediately aware you've arrived somewhere a little special. At this elegant and refined Italian restaurant you aren't so much as welcomed in as taken in hand and enveloped in a sort of benevolent bubble of care. It's a grown up establishment with a suitably urbane clientele who all look at home in this part of town. Sit in the main dining room where all the action happens, rather than in the alcove off the bar-which is undoubtedly-Siberia. As the name suggests, seafood and shellfish lie at the heart of the menu. And needless to say, the ingredients are not only of irreproachable quality but are also treated with respect and deftness by the kitchen, whether it's the brilliant white halibut or the salt-baked wild bass. Start with the crudo, and then head for a generous bowl of homemade pasta such as tagliolini with clams and calamari, followed by a whole fish or a classic entrée. It's not of course compulsory to stick to fish-the lamb chops make a worthy alternative. The wine list is a deserving tome and along with the big names are some lesser known growers who merit investigation.

Though the focus is on the eats, the room is comfortably outfitted with brick red terrazzo floors and grey-trimmed walls. Blonde wood tables are set with bottles of hot sauce, pepper vinegar, and wild flowers.

			""How many?"" That's the greeting at this temple of ""ma la,"" where enticing aromas are sure to lure you in. Find yourself among executives and locals slurping up a host of chili oil specialties (don't wear white!). This is the kind of place where dragons go to recharge their breath. Some may peruse the menu-rife with typos-for daily specials, but most blaze their tongues with Sichuan pickles or chilled noodles tossed in an intense sesame vinaigrette. The place is named after a humble dish, but many items surprise with bold flavors like silky fish fillets swimming in a spicy broth with Napa cabbage, or camphor tea-smoked duck. Peppercorns in stir-fried chicken unite subtle sweetness with intense heat, while sponge squash offers a cooling, textural finale.

			Tempura may be considered a more common pleasure in Japan, but it has been refined to an art form at this home to succulent morsels of fish and vegetables. There is no equal in the city and the kitchen's delicate hand and authenticity is particularly clear in the lightly seasoned batter that sparingly coats each bit of food before it is quickly fried and rendered crisp. The skill here is so great that they could probably get away with serving lesser quality fish, but still, these are often imported from Tsukiji market in Tokyo at their peak of freshness. Don't miss the sweet shrimp wrapped in shiso leaf and butterflied Japanese whiting served with purple sweet potato. Meals are bookended with premium sashimi and cooked dishes that are just as enticing, like seared butterfish with a tiny radish, spring pea, and onion. Tilefish is prepared with flavors that seem to conjure spring thanks to cherry leaves, uni, and braised broccoli over sticky rice with sesame and goji berries. The best place to appreciate the kitchen's artistry is from the counter where chefs can be found carefully dipping each little golden nugget of food in and out of boiling oil, then promptly placing it before you. Though sadly Chef Matsui has passed away, his disciples carry on.

			Upbeat, modern, and cool, the Llama Inn pays respect to all styles of Peruvian cooking, but with the technical flair of a chef who has trained in New York's top restaurants. The result is a fresh, fun, and spontaneous cuisine that aims to elevate Peruvian food. Fish courses are notable, and nowhere is that more clear than in the fresh and expertly cut raw sea bream tiradito with persimmon, ginger, yuzu, and nutty poppy seeds. Fluke ceviche is just as memorable, served in a bit of dashi with lime, onion, cilantro, aji, and wonderfully spicy leche de tigre.

While its interior appears to be getting even more disheveled by the day, high-backed banquettes and colorful accent lights provide a respite of sorts once you make it through the doors. Recent experiences have indicated inconsistent cooking, but the fiery and smoky specialties here are still praiseworthy. Nibble on a crispy pile of camphor tea-smoked duck while waiting for the more standout items to arrive.

The décor is nothing to write home about-though it's cute and disheveled in all the right ways and boasts a mean ""backyard."" But, their pan-Chinese dishes have certainly set tongues a wagging.

			If you've ever had Brooklyn envy, buckle your seatbelt. Tucked among rows of brownstones straight off the set of a movie, The Finch's charming location pulls at your heart strings long before Chef Gabe McMackin's outrageously good food warms your soul. Duck behind the bright blue façade, and things get even better: a warm staff welcomes you to a charming, rustic décor, replete with wood beam ceilings and farmhouse chairs. At the heart of this expansive space, which sprawls out into a series of cozy nooks, is an open kitchen where the chef extraordinaire guides his team to excellence before an audience of diners seated at a Carrara marble counter. Modern yet comforting, McMackin's dishes mix skill and personality. The food is well-executed, satisfying and carefully sourced from tender shishito peppers, blistered to perfection, with a squirt of lemon and crunchy sea salt, to shaved lamb tongue with fennel, green olives, orange and chili. Chewy cavatelli with yellow foot chanterelles, broccoli rabe, nettles and smoked yolk is yet another highlight, while six slices of spot-on Berkshire pork fanned over Calypso beans, littleneck clams, chicory and a sumptuously spicy broth is a fine way to end the affair.

			Blink and you'll miss its inconspicuous façade, but what a shame, for Café China is a little journey into the magnificent pleasures of Sichuan cuisine by way of midtown. Inside find a long, narrow space fitted out with seductive portraits of 1930's Shanghai starlets, bright red chairs, bamboo planters and a dominating marble-and-wood bar. After struggling with their on-again-off-again popularity, this kitchen is back to their A-game, producing Sichuan (and Sichuan-influenced) dishes with aplomb. Their particular strength lies in the elegant and effortless contrast of complex flavors, even when the prep is decidedly simple-as in the delicious steamed eggplant and ginger sautéed duck. Pickled vegetables achieve harmonious balance between sour and fiery notes; while thinly sliced conch pairs perfectly with tingly chili oil. Sichuan pork dumplings arrive in a delicate wrapper and atop a delicious bath of soy and chili oil. But save space to savor the Chungking chicken, alternately tender and crispy, with abundant dried chilies, scallions and sesame seeds. Spicy cumin lamb, fried to gamey perfection and tossed with sesame seeds, chili peppers and cilantro, is yet another smoky treat.

The kitchen lives up to its hype by ignoring new wave trends in favor of serving classically assembled and spectacularly fresh sushi. Every item is handled with the utmost care, especially the progression of sashimi highlighting the ample textures of mackerel, tuna, and salmon. Outstanding clams and scallops are seasoned with a touch of lemon and sea salt flakes to enhance their natural taste; while nigiri featuring Maine and Japanese uni tastings underscore the subtle differences in flavor.

			When Claus Meyer opens a New York restaurant, there is an undeniable ""Noma factor"" that has locals running to the door (hidden as it is on the corner of Vanderbilt and 42nd). The design is gorgeous, drinks are outstanding, and the location is ideal for midtown business lunches-of a certain type. Dining here is pleasing as well as cerebral and unapologetically expressive of the New Nordic food scene, without a flight to Copenhagen. They may be using local ingredients, but that distinctive Scandinavian style dominates every dish. Bitter, sour, and fermented flavors reappear throughout each meal, perhaps beginning with a snack that combines icy oysters with pine needles. The salt and ash-baked beet is an instant signature that summarizes the kitchen's talents: it is cracked tableside for a dramatic presentation of earthy, sweet beets balanced with an aggressively acidic vinegar sauce, crème fraîche, leaves and shoots, all accompanied by their fantastic bread. This may seem like a lot of fuss, but it is unpretentious and thoroughly delicious. Desserts might virtually explode with rhubarb, sorrel, and the flavors of a summer garden.

Dinner is more low-key but the menu always brims with simple, good quality, and slightly renovated plates like warm hummus with pastirma; lentil and bulgur tartare; or watermelon chunks tossed with salty feta, tomatoes, and olive oil. A forkful of their model and deliciously tender chicken adana with a side of addictively crispy fries has wide appeal and makes for a fitting feast-at all times.

			Proving that the death of fine dining has been grossly exaggerated, Alsace-born Gabriel Kreuther's eponymous midtown restaurant offers artfully designed surroundings, creative and eye-catching food, and service that is formal and quite ceremonial. It's certainly a striking room, with columns of reclaimed wood juxtaposed with creamy white leather seating and a glass wall offering glimpses of the impressively calm goings-on in the kitchen. The table settings are immaculate too, with delicate glassware, cups and bowls that you can't stop stroking, and surgically thin modern cutlery that you'll either love or hate. The chef's classical culinary upbringing underpins his modern creations and his Alsatian heritage plays a role too. Alongside kugelhopf, you'll also find sauerkraut-it makes an appearance in one of his more theatrical dishes where it's mixed with sturgeon, garnished with caviar and presented at the table with the lifting of a glass cloche filled with applewood smoke. The desserts, if you can get past their somewhat pretentious monikers (""revisited"" or ""ethereal"" anyone?) show that the pastry section is also given license to push boundaries.

			Chef-owner Jake Eberle's cute corner restaurant shows us that not every dish needs reimagining and not every recipe requires reinterpretation. He's a French-trained chef whose cooking is crisp, clean, and comfortingly classic-and his well-balanced menu includes words like ""roulade"" and ""blancmange"" that here seem curiously reassuring. That's not to say his food doesn't pack a punch: the rich, meaty cassoulet could keep an army on the march for days. Globe lights hang from the ceiling to illuminate a sea-blue room with bespoke wooden furniture. The acoustics can be bouncy and those lacking the necessary padding will find the seating a little numbing. But, there is honest toil and earnest endeavor happening here and it deserves support.

			Italian hospitality with a Pugliese accent is on display at Mercato, a rustic trattoria in the western midtown hinterlands. The space is country-chic, with distressed wood tables, soft, exposed bulbs, and vintage signs. The atmosphere is inviting and the menu is inspired by the classic dishes of Puglia, the birthplace of owner Fabio Camardi. First get a drink in your hand, then start with fave e cicoria, a straightforward purée of fava beans and garlicky chicory greens. A well-rounded Italian meal must have pasta, so be sure to indulge in the likes of orecchiette with broccoli rabe and garlic, enhanced by anchovies and breadcrumbs. For something deeply satisfying, try the fennel-dusted porchetta with a hearty side of potato and green cabbage mash.

Think of it as a miniature oasis of Mediterranean hospitality, for at Snack EOS, the service is warm and genuine; the space simple but cozy; and the menu full of pristine seafood and simply prepared meats, bursting with fragrant herbs. The kitchen churns out a variety of dips (cool and creamy tzatzikis and nutty muhammara made with piquant harissa) and small plates (like saganaki and roasted octopus) to start. It's the perfect prelude for heartier dinner fare like halloumi skewers or lamb loin. And there's even a reasonably priced three-course prix-fixe.

Regardless of the time of day, Okonomi's delightfully unconstrained Japanese cuisine is a compelling reason to visit. Locally grown produce and domestic fish are the foundation of the high-quality ichiju sansai, a set lunch of shioyaki (salt-grilled) or miso-marinated broiled fish, rice, miso soup, and shira-ae (wilted greens with a tofu dressing). Come evening, the focus shifts to ramen, with each steaming bowl bearing the distinctive hand of the skilled chef.

			Eric Ripert's paean to all things piscatorial is unquestionably one of the daddies of the New York dining scene. No one gets to occupy this amount of prime midtown real estate for this long without knowing exactly what they're doing-and doing it supremely well. Run with consummate ease by a well-organized team, its influence stretches beyond merely the entertaining of big-hitters and even bigger spenders. But however celebrated, the sine qua non of any self-respecting seafood restaurant must be the ability to cook a piece of fish absolutely perfectly and, in this, Le Bernardin displays deftness and consistency. Just try the luxuriantly buttery wild striped bass and you'll get the idea. ""Almost Raw,"" ""Barely Touched,"" and ""Lightly Cooked"" are the headings under which you'll find an impressive array of dishes. The influences are global but the cooking is underpinned by a mastery of technique; ingredients are of unimpeachable quality and the kitchen has the confidence to never overcrowd a plate so that the fish always remains the star of the show.

			This seafood-centric grill looks onto the iconic Rockefeller Center ice-skating rink and is framed by a wall of windows. Inside, find a cool aqua-accented space that inspires dressing up. Yes, tourists flock here after a spin on the ice, but it is also popular among business crowds-especially at lunch when the bar is bustling with sharp suits munching on lobster tail with a martini on the side. The food itself is light and fresh. In-season you may find soft-shelled crab, served alongside a seaweed salad with citrus-marinated hearts of palm. The Northeast supplies many local seafood choices, such as the Block Island golden snapper a la plancha, with tangy cherry-tomato vinaigrette. Dependable and familiar classics like jumbo lump crab cakes are also on offer.

			Sitting proudly on this corner for 40-some years, Smith & Wollensky is a bona fide institution. This is the kind of clubby steakhouse where stellar martinis are still poured tableside and the regulars get their names engraved on a plaque. It's where business deals go down and a number of old-time guys live it up. Begin with dangerously warm and buttery Parker House rolls before savoring a beefsteak tomato-onion salad finished with house dressing and blue cheese. Spoon-licking plates of creamed spinach, hashbrowns, or onion rings are a must alongside the all-time favorite Colorado rib steak-beautifully marbled, deliciously fatty, bone-on and big enough for three. For those who prefer a bit of blare with their meat, Wollensky's Grill next door is ideal.

It's exceptionally quaint and cozy; the guests are friendly and often local; and the vibe is perfectly laid-back. And while the space is decidedly unflashy, the refined dishes showcase a delicious interplay between quality ingredients and the notable talents of the kitchen. Kick things off with a mouthwatering bowl of chilled corn soup, served sweet and creamy and garnished with roasted poblano peppers, gouda, pico de gallo, and fresh cilantro. Then move on to a lovely fillet of bluefish, roasted to crispy-outside-and-tender-inside perfection, and served over nutty wild rice with snap pea slivers and a mild green curry emulsion.

			No playful pun, no name-check for grandma, no oblique reference to a geographical landmark-whoever christened this restaurant clearly wanted to attract a certain type of customer. This is not the place where you should order by pointing vaguely at the menu-that way lies trouble because you may find yourself having to re-mortgage your apartment to pay for the 250 grams of Osetra caviar you've just inadvertently requested. Best leave that section of the carte to the oligarchs and retired dictators and concentrate on the main menu. Here you will find contemporary dishes of surprising delicacy and precision, with a pleasing bias towards wonderful seafood and shellfish, such as scallops with ricotta gnudi, or delicious bluefin tuna with uni and asparagus. You get buzzed in at street level, which adds a bit of mystery to proceedings. Up the stairs and you'll find yourself in a lavish little jewel box, with colorful murals on the wall, Murano chandeliers hanging from an ornate ceiling, and semi-circular booths. The only thing missing is James Bond's nemesis drumming his fingers on the table in the corner.

The smartly attired staff attends to a buttoned-up crowd digging into pricey but pleasing fare like shaved artichoke salad with organic frisée, lemon, olive oil, and bottarga di muggine.

The fresh, light cuisine begins with beautifully prepared starters like tender, enticingly charred octopus atop chickpeas, roasted pepper, and quick-pickled onions drizzled with lemon and olive oil.

Firstly, the restaurant boasts a hugely impressive and ever expanding collection of Andy Warhol portraits, ranging from the Shah of Iran to Rudolf Nureyev.

			It goes without saying that The Modern has one of the city's most prized locations, designed to capture the iconic feel of the MoMA in which it is seamlessly housed. A brief closure for an ambitious kitchen renovation and nip-tuck of the dining rooms brings The Modern back better than ever. Art enthusiasts have always appreciated its timeless and glorious surrounds and are sure to notice the improved acoustics, which facilitate quiet conversation and match the calm of the view over the sculpture garden. The state-of-the-art kitchen should allow the team to grow into its full creative potential-both in the dining room and at the buzzy bar. Chef Abram Bissell and crew are truly wowing these globe-trotting patrons with excellent food and warm, well-timed service. Appealing dishes showcase clean flavors and may include roasted cauliflower composed with creamy crab butter, almond-cauliflower purée, and crabmeat. Delicate balance and top ingredients are at the height of an exceedingly tender lobster ""marinated with truffles"" and served in a luscious sauce with radishes and bright herbs.

			It's not just carnivores who'll appreciate this most classic of steakhouses; Anglophiles, social historians, Scotch lovers and pipe smokers will also find themselves revelling in the immeasurably appealing atmosphere of Keens and its palpable sense of times past. Established in 1885, it suggests a Dickensian Gentleman's club, with its dark wood panelling and low ceiling lined with thousands of clay pipes, although these days the customers are mostly deal-making business types rather than extravagantly whiskered thespians. Follow their lead and drape your jacket over the back of your chair, roll up your sleeves and attempt to gain control over a Porterhouse steak, dry-aged in-house, or finish their legendary mutton chop in one sitting.

			Owner Paul Giannone, aka Paulie Gee, channeled a lifelong love of pizza into this charmingly delicious spot that feels as if it has been around forever. Rustic in appearance, the room's cool concrete and brick are warmed by the glow of the wood-burning oven imported from Naples. From here, Giannone and his son work their magic. The addictive crust is beguilingly moist and chewy, perfumed with smoke, and adroitly salted. Killer wood-fired pies dominate the menu with tempting combinations, excellent ingredients, and whimsical names. Offerings may include the Harry Belafontina-fontina, tomatoes, beefy meatballs, cremini mushrooms, and golden raisins. Vegans get equal respect here, with an added menu of vegan cheese and house-made vegan sausage.

			This neighborhood mainstay boasts over fifty years of success. With their fantastic menu, killer margaritas, and dedication to hospitality, El Parador is worthy of its status as a beloved destination. The intimate space is decked with ornate wood chairs, red banquettes, and wood plank ceilings, while white brick walls are hung with artwork and artifacts. The bountiful menu offers favorites like taco trays and nachos in three varieties, as well as a rotating menu of daily specials (be sure to try the fish of the day). Fill up on aguachile de camaron, deliciously classic shrimp ceviche in lime juice and jalapeño; or tender, falling-off-the-bone baby-back ribs served with tequila-chili guajillo salsa, cabbage slaw, and braised camote. Margaritas are a must, but of course.

			Windows overlook the Empire State Building at the long and light-filled Stella 34, located on the sixth floor of Macy's. The space is contemporary-with mosaic-tile floors, bare tabletops, and coffee-colored banquettes. But the food is pure comfort, with three wood-burning ovens churning out Neapolitan-style pizzas. A meal at the curvaceous bar would best begin with some salumi and formaggi, or pappa al pomodoro thick with bread, tomato, Tuscan kale, white beans, and Pecorino Romano. Pasta is as enticing as the crispy pizzas-cresta di gallo satisfies with escarole maccheroni (in the shape of a rooster's crest) tossed with tomatoes, red onion, chilies, guanciale, and pecorino. For dessert, the renowned Vivoli gelato arrives here straight from Florence.

The cavernous space boasts a clubby vibe and boisterous businessmen make this a lively choice. Light streaming in from lofty windows shows off a white-tiled bar area framed by black-and-white photographs, and a pastel-green Vespa adds an extra dose of charm. But, look past the somewhat staged design and focus on the food-you'll be pleasantly surprised. The menu is executed with unexpected elegance and care. Tables may cradle snacks like warm hand-pulled mozzarella, Neapolitan-style pizza, and mains like Mediterranean branzino with puttanesca. Deftly prepared pasta like ridged tubes of rigatoncini with Bolognese is a worthy indulgence.

Its name refers to the two stones used to grind grain; the location is just blocks from where the city's first tide-water grist mill once stood; and a Per Se alum heads the fantastic bakery. Inside, the theme continues with walls constructed of concrete blocks shaped like flour sacks.

Each has an impressive resume, and together the result is a unique labor of love. Nightly specials are displayed via a wall-mounted blackboard with small plates progressing to a handful of entrées. Monkfish hot pot features ankimo-enriched miso broth, ground shrimp balls, glass noodles, and a heap of fragrant fresh herbs. The house-baked sake kasu challah with raisin butter is a highly recommended start.

			Texas-style barbecue has come to Brooklyn, even if this 'cue begins in an 18-foot smoke pit located a few blocks away, thereby keeping its on-site kitchen free from wood smoke. Instead, it remains focused on creamy mac n' cheese, whiskey sour pickles, and mayo-mustardy potato salad. Meats arrive sweet and tender enough to have a caramel crunch, while smoky sausages snap and explode with juice and chili-spiced bite-each is sold by the plump quarter-pound link. Ribs are cooked until the moment before they fall off the bone; and desserts feature Steve's Key lime pie locally made in Red Hook.

Burgers are popular, but the cooking here is thoroughly delicious. Start with potato-ricotta gnocchi tossed with walnuts, wild mushrooms, and finished with rosemary oil for a smart and pleasing interplay of flavors. The veal piccata is also excellent, pounded thin and served in a marvelous lemon-caper sauce splashed with white wine, alongside artichoke hearts and bright green fava beans.

The space started out as a bakery long ago, but the heart of today's operation is actually a century-old oven that was only recently discovered and restored. The menu is full of surprises that go well beyond pizza joint standards, including surprisingly good pasta dishes. For instance, pillowy gnocchi should be a contender for top billing as it is tossed with chunky beef shank ragù, enriched with marrow, red wine, and then elegantly garnished with cress. Still, that pepperoni pizza is really good, with a puffed and charred crust topped with coins of smoky chorizo, pecorino, and tart tomato sauce.

The service can be gruff at times, but they have a good track record of squeezing you into a table or perch at the bar without a reservation. Once seated, the bone-in Porterhouse, cooked rare, is the only way to go. It arrives sizzling in its own fat, perfectly seasoned.

A genuine sense of contentedness fills the packed room, as guests enjoy small plates of monster prawns, grilled quickly in their steaming shells, finished with garlic, parsley, and a hint of spice.

Have the best of both worlds with the soup and half-sandwich combination. Carve a nook during midday rush, when in pour the crowds.

An expansion has created additional seating in this two-level dining room, done up in spare, earthy hues and traditional wooden screens. It's classic, clean and simple-the message is clear. At Kunjip, the focus is most decidedly on the food. Barbecue is always popular, and is done quite well at dinner. The menu, however, reaches much wider with a long list of hearty soups (a big hit with the lunch crowd), stews, and casseroles.

With a retro décor that spans two floors and a business that's run like a machine, Hatsuhana is a go-to for corporate dining. Though the rave reviews came decades ago, their traditional Edomae sushi still holds its own. Fish is top quality, the army of chefs have solid knife skills, and rice is properly prepared. This reliability draws a host of regulars who develop relationships with the itamae. Stick to the counter and go omakase: the sushi will be surprisingly impressive with accommodations for the spicy tuna-set.

			It doesn't get more old-world New York than this iconic Restaurant Row institution. Opened in 1906, Barbetta is a testament to proper dining out: men are required to don dinner jackets, outerwear is mandatorily checked, and a brigade of starched servers flit about the hushed and gilded surrounds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the impossibly romantic patio has been the backdrop for countless marriage proposals. The kitchen's Northern-influenced specialties are listed on thick cardstock, and each selection is highlighted by the year of its addition to the menu. Linguine with pesto alla Genovese is as scrumptious today as it was in 1914; while luscious rabbit alla Piemontese, dating back to the Clinton era and braised in white wine and lemon, is equally divine.

This midtown gem, adorned with billowing muslin and neutral tones, provides its savvy diners with tranquil, sophisticated surroundings that go hand-in-hand with the sweet-natured staff.

Cauliflower Manchurian, highlighting deliciously fried florets tossed in zingy chili-tomato sauce, is nothing less than textbook-perfect. You may also travel north by way of zafrani jhinga or tandoor-roasted shrimp served with a delightful combo of crispy okra, upma, and spicy eggplant chutney. Then kasuri seekh kabab is sparked with gooseberry relish for all-out enjoyment, while the buttery black dal must be tailed by an outstandingly light and fluffy naan for a definitive finish.

			Thanks to the culinary expertise of Chef Geoffrey Zakarian, the curiously un-apostrophized Lambs Club delivers a reliably good dining experience thanks to cooking that is far more capable than the somewhat generic menu would suggest. Moments of subtle innovation never come at the expense of flavor and there's an appealing clarity and freshness to dishes like homemade spaghetti with crab and chili, a well-judged tuna tartare, and a smooth panna cotta. At lunch the large fireplace goes some way to compensating for the lack of windows. Dinner feels more intimate and less corporate-something that the society of thespians to which the name refers would surely have preferred. Just get to the table first so you can snare the banquette rather than the oddly low-set chairs.

			If this sensual and sophisticated lair doesn't come to mind when you crave quality Cantonese cooking, it's high time you added it to the list. Behind its front door lies a long, moodily-lit corridor that leads to a massive dining room, which, thanks to cobalt-blue glass, Carrara marble, and mirrors, feels intimate despite its size. The equally elegant menu underscores mouthwatering dishes like jasmine tea-smoked chicken and stir-fried sugar pea pods with crabmeat and scallops; or bamboo steamers full of scallop siu mai topped with tobiko, King crab noodle rolls, as well as truffle and roasted duck bao. The prix-fixe dim sum, a wallet-friendly delight that synchs perfectly with Hakkasan's luxe tenor, is yet another decadent surprise.

			Just a stone's throw from the Broadway hustle lies this little oasis of rustic hospitality. Follow its blue awning into a charming dining room and you'll find cozy banquettes, friendly black-and-white uniformed servers with nary a pretense among them, and a romantic second-level balcony offering magical date night possibilities. Dinner kicks off with a basket of bread, olive oil, and a few delicious briny olives. The menu, despite its Venetian slant, presents those familiar yet well-conceived Italian-American staples (cue the dessert tray loaded with over-the-top cream-filled sweets). Of course, specials are usually crafted with the best of the season and are worth trying-maybe chewy tagliolini alla chitarra served in a veal ragù and laced with mushrooms as well as finely diced carrots.

			Chef Daniel Boulud's midtown canteen is fashioned by Jeffrey Beers and dons a contemporary demeanor. The front lounge is abuzz with post-work and pre-theater gaggles, while well-behaved crowds in the back are seated in a walnut-paneled space dressed with mirrors and black-and-white photography. Like its setting, the menu is inventive and unites classic bistro cooking with market-inspired creations. That lush pâté en croute is a buttery pastry encasing layers of creamy country pâté, guinea hen, and foie gras, dressed with huckleberry compote, toasted pine nuts, and pickled enoki mushrooms. Wild rice-crusted fluke presented with Hawaiian blue prawn and sauce Américaine further demonstrates the kitchen's contemporary leanings.
