For ex: take a week to return a voicemail or a few days for a text. As the weeks go by, the lag between all communications gradually increases. Never answer the phone if you see that person's number on your caller ID. Wait at least a week to return the message (unless it's an emergency), preferably via text. Avoid face-to-face meetings (like coffee or lunch) and make excuses to skip activities you both enjoyed previously (like going to the movies).The goal is to gently un-friend that person at a kind and gingerly pace. It can be a very effective method for those averse to conflict or part of tightly knit groups. Over time, your feelings may change, and you may want to rekindle the friendship. With this method, you haven't burned all your bridges.",4115,friendly fade"

Jesus was radiating with a bright white light because he was rocking so hard.The art of the air guitar was thus written down in the Bible and succesfully passed on to man.  The practice of air guitar since it's inception has been shown throughout the history of the world.  Jesus is discretely air guitaring in the famous painting The Last Supper in the Galleria Borghese, Rome.On and on has this holy tradition gone.  It is kept alive by generations of rockers young and old.
