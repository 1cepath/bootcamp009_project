      "utmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make\r\n",
      "the facts public; but now the principal person concerned is beyond the\r\n",

      "turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced\r\n",
      "at it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor.\r\n",
      "I picked it up and read:--\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Watson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo and see the\r\n",
      "slithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and\r\n",
      "wicked, flattened faces? Well, that’s how Milverton impresses me. I’ve\r\n",
      "had to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never\r\n",
      "gave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can’t get\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven\r\n",
      "help the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come\r\n",
      "into the power of Milverton. With a smiling face and a heart of marble\r\n",
      "he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is\r\n",
      "a genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury\r\n",
      "trade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is\r\n",
      "prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of\r\n",
      "wealth or position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous\r\n",
      "valets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained\r\n",
      "the confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard\r\n",
      "hand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman\r\n",
      "for a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was\r\n",
      "the result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and\r\n",
      "there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No\r\n",
      "one knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too\r\n",
      "cunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years\r\n",
      "in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning.\r\n",
      "I have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how\r\n",
      "could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with\r\n",
      "this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and\r\n",
      "wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But surely,” said I, “the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a\r\n",
      "woman, for example, to get him a few months’ imprisonment if her own\r\n",
      "ruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he\r\n",
      "blackmailed an innocent person, then, indeed, we should have him; but he\r\n",
      "is as cunning as the Evil One. No, no; we must find other ways to fight\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And why is he here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands.\r\n",
      "It is the Lady Eva Brackwell, the most beautiful DEBUTANTE of last\r\n",
      "season. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt.\r\n",
      "This fiend has several imprudent letters--imprudent, Watson, nothing\r\n",
      "worse--which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country.\r\n",
      "They would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the\r\n",
      "letters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been\r\n",
      "commissioned to meet him, and--to make the best terms I can.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below.\r\n",
      "Looking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps\r\n",
      "gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A footman\r\n",
      "opened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrachan overcoat\r\n",
      "descended. A minute later he was in the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large,\r\n",
      "intellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen\r\n",
      "smile, and two keen grey eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad,\r\n",
      "golden-rimmed glasses. There was something of Mr. Pickwick’s benevolence\r\n",
      "in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and\r\n",
      "by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice\r\n",
      "was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump\r\n",
      "little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his\r\n",
      "first visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him\r\n",
      "with a face of granite. Milverton’s smile broadened; he shrugged his\r\n",
      "shoulders, removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over\r\n",
      "the back of a chair, and then took a seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This gentleman?” said he, with a wave in my direction. “Is it discreet?\r\n",
      "Is it right?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your client’s interests that I\r\n",
      "protested. The matter is so very delicate----”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dr. Watson has already heard of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then we can proceed to business. You say that you are acting for Lady\r\n",
      "Eva. Has she empowered you to accept my terms?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are your terms?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Seven thousand pounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the alternative?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it; but if the money is\r\n",
      "not paid on the 14th there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.”\r\n",
      " His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes thought for a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You appear to me,” he said, at last, “to be taking matters too much for\r\n",
      "granted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters.\r\n",
      "My client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall counsel her to\r\n",
      "tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milverton chuckled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You evidently do not know the Earl,” said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the baffled look upon Holmes’s face I could see clearly that he\r\n",
      "did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What harm is there in the letters?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are sprightly--very sprightly,” Milverton answered. “The lady\r\n",
      "was a charming correspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of\r\n",
      "Dovercourt would fail to appreciate them. However, since you think\r\n",
      "otherwise, we will let it rest at that. It is purely a matter of\r\n",
      "business. If you think that it is in the best interests of your client\r\n",
      "that these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you\r\n",
      "would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.”\r\n",
      " He rose and seized his astrachan coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes was grey with anger and mortification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wait a little,” he said. “You go too fast. We would certainly make\r\n",
      "every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milverton relapsed into his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was sure that you would see it in that light,” he purred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At the same time,” Holmes continued, “Lady Eva is not a wealthy\r\n",
      "woman. I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her\r\n",
      "resources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. I beg,\r\n",
      "therefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return\r\n",
      "the letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest\r\n",
      "that you can get.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milverton’s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am aware that what you say is true about the lady’s resources,” said\r\n",
      "he. “At the same time, you must admit that the occasion of a lady’s\r\n",
      "marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to\r\n",
      "make some little effort upon her behalf. They may hesitate as to an\r\n",
      "acceptable wedding present. Let me assure them that this little bundle\r\n",
      "of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes\r\n",
      "in London.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is impossible,” said Holmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!” cried Milverton, taking out a bulky\r\n",
      "pocket-book. “I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in\r\n",
      "not making an effort. Look at this!” He held up a little note with a\r\n",
      "coat-of-arms upon the envelope. “That belongs to--well, perhaps it is\r\n",
      "hardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. But at that time\r\n",
      "it will be in the hands of the lady’s husband. And all because she will\r\n",
      "not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds\r\n",
      "into paste. It IS such a pity. Now, you remember the sudden end of the\r\n",
      "engagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only\r\n",
      "two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the MORNING POST\r\n",
      "to say that it was all off. And why? It is almost incredible, but\r\n",
      "the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole\r\n",
      "question. Is it not pitiful? And here I find you, a man of sense,\r\n",
      "boggling about terms when your client’s future and honour are at stake.\r\n",
      "You surprise me, Mr. Holmes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What I say is true,” Holmes answered. “The money cannot be found.\r\n",
      "Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer\r\n",
      "than to ruin this woman’s career, which can profit you in no way?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me\r\n",
      "indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases\r\n",
      "maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe\r\n",
      "example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to\r\n",
      "reason. You see my point?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes sprang from his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get behind him, Watson! Don’t let him out! Now, sir, let us see the\r\n",
      "contents of that note-book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and\r\n",
      "stood with his back against the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,” he said, turning the front of his coat and\r\n",
      "exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside\r\n",
      "pocket. “I have been expecting you to do something original. This has\r\n",
      "been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you\r\n",
      "that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my\r\n",
      "weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition\r\n",
      "that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken.\r\n",
      "I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two\r\n",
      "little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.”\r\n",
      " He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and\r\n",
      "turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and\r\n",
      "I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out\r\n",
      "of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage\r\n",
      "door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser\r\n",
      "pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing\r\n",
      "embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture\r\n",
      "of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed\r\n",
      "into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee\r\n",
      "beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into\r\n",
      "the street. “I’ll be back some time, Watson,” said he, and vanished into\r\n",
      "the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles\r\n",
      "Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that\r\n",
      "campaign was destined to take.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but\r\n",
      "beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was\r\n",
      "not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on\r\n",
      "a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against\r\n",
      "the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed\r\n",
      "his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent\r\n",
      "inward fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll be interested to hear that I am engaged.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear fellow! I congrat----”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To Milverton’s housemaid.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens, Holmes!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted information, Watson.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely you have gone too far?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber with a rising business,\r\n",
      "Escott by name. I have walked out with her each evening, and I have\r\n",
      "talked with her. Good heavens, those talks! However, I have got all I\r\n",
      "wanted. I know Milverton’s house as I know the palm of my hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the girl, Holmes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t help it, my dear Watson. You must play your cards as best you\r\n",
      "can when such a stake is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that\r\n",
      "I have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my\r\n",
      "back is turned. What a splendid night it is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You like this weather?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton’s house\r\n",
      "to-night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words,\r\n",
      "which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a\r\n",
      "flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of\r\n",
      "a wide landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result\r\n",
      "of such an action--the detection, the capture, the honoured career\r\n",
      "ending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at\r\n",
      "the mercy of the odious Milverton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For Heaven’s sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,” I cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never\r\n",
      "precipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and indeed so\r\n",
      "dangerous a course if any other were possible. Let us look at the matter\r\n",
      "clearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action is\r\n",
      "morally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house\r\n",
      "is no more than to forcibly take his pocket-book--an action in which you\r\n",
      "were prepared to aid me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I turned it over in my mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” I said; “it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to\r\n",
      "take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable I have only to consider the\r\n",
      "question of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress\r\n",
      "upon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will be in such a false position.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of\r\n",
      "regaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and\r\n",
      "there are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is\r\n",
      "the last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night this\r\n",
      "villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. I\r\n",
      "must, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or I must play this\r\n",
      "last card. Between ourselves, Watson, it’s a sporting duel between\r\n",
      "this fellow Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best of the first\r\n",
      "exchanges; but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight\r\n",
      "it to a finish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I don’t like it; but I suppose it must be,” said I. “When do we\r\n",
      "start?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not coming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you are not going,” said I. “I give you my word of honour--and\r\n",
      "I never broke it in my life--that I will take a cab straight to the\r\n",
      "police-station and give you away unless you let me share this adventure\r\n",
      "with you.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“How do you know that? You can’t tell what may happen. Anyway, my\r\n",
      "resolution is taken. Other people beside you have self-respect and even\r\n",
      "reputations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on\r\n",
      "the shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We have shared the same room\r\n",
      "for some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the\r\n",
      "same cell. You know, Watson, I don’t mind confessing to you that I have\r\n",
      "always had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal.\r\n",
      "This is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. See here!” He took\r\n",
      "a neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited\r\n",
      "a number of shining instruments. “This is a first-class, up-to-date\r\n",
      "burgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter,\r\n",
      "adaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of\r\n",
      "civilization demands. Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in\r\n",
      "order. Have you a pair of silent shoes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excellent. And a mask?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can make a couple out of black silk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing.\r\n",
      "Very good; do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before\r\n",
      "we start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as\r\n",
      "Church Row. It is a quarter of an hour’s walk from there to Appledore\r\n",
      "Towers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy\r\n",
      "sleeper and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With any luck we should be\r\n",
      "back here by two, with the Lady Eva’s letters in my pocket.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Holmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two\r\n",
      "theatre-goers homeward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and\r\n",
      "drove to an address in Hampstead. Here we paid off our cab, and with our\r\n",
      "great-coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold and the wind seemed to\r\n",
      "blow through us, we walked along the edge of the Heath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a business that needs delicate treatment,” said Holmes. “These\r\n",
      "documents are contained in a safe in the fellow’s study, and the study\r\n",
      "is the ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand, like all these\r\n",
      "stout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper.\r\n",
      "Agatha--that’s my FIANCEE--says it is a joke in the servants’ hall that\r\n",
      "it’s impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted to\r\n",
      "his interests and never budges from the study all day. That’s why we are\r\n",
      "going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden. I\r\n",
      "met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so\r\n",
      "as to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own\r\n",
      "grounds. Through the gate--now to the right among the laurels. We might\r\n",
      "put on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light\r\n",
      "in any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most\r\n",
      "truculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house.\r\n",
      "A sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several\r\n",
      "windows and two doors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s his bedroom,” Holmes whispered. “This door opens straight into\r\n",
      "the study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked,\r\n",
      "and we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There’s a\r\n",
      "greenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned\r\n",
      "the key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door\r\n",
      "behind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick,\r\n",
      "warm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic\r\n",
      "plants took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the darkness and led\r\n",
      "me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. Holmes\r\n",
      "had remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark.\r\n",
      "Still holding my hand in one of his he opened a door, and I was vaguely\r\n",
      "conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been\r\n",
      "smoked not long before. He felt his way among the furniture, opened\r\n",
      "another door, and closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt\r\n",
      "several coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a\r\n",
      "passage. We passed along it, and Holmes very gently opened a door upon\r\n",
      "the right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into\r\n",
      "my mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat.\r\n",
      "A fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with\r\n",
      "tobacco smoke. Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and\r\n",
      "then very gently closed the door. We were in Milverton’s study, and a\r\n",
      "PORTIERE at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. Near the door I\r\n",
      "saw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it\r\n",
      "had been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fireplace was a heavy\r\n",
      "curtain, which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. On the\r\n",
      "other side was the door which communicated with the veranda. A desk\r\n",
      "stood in the centre, with a turning chair of shining red leather.\r\n",
      "Opposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on the top.\r\n",
      "In the corner between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green\r\n",
      "safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its\r\n",
      "face. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then he crept to the door of\r\n",
      "the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening intently. No sound\r\n",
      "came from within. Meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise\r\n",
      "to secure our retreat through the outer door, so I examined it. To my\r\n",
      "amazement it was neither locked nor bolted! I touched Holmes on the arm,\r\n",
      "and he turned his masked face in that direction. I saw him start, and he\r\n",
      "was evidently as surprised as I.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t like it,” he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. “I\r\n",
      "can’t quite make it out. Anyhow, we have no time to lose.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can I do anything?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; stand by the door. If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside,\r\n",
      "and we can get away as we came. If they come the other way, we can\r\n",
      "get through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window\r\n",
      "curtains if it is not. Do you understand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I nodded and stood by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed\r\n",
      "away, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when\r\n",
      "we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. The high object\r\n",
      "of our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous,\r\n",
      "the villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting\r\n",
      "interest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and\r\n",
      "exulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes\r\n",
      "unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm,\r\n",
      "scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I\r\n",
      "knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I\r\n",
      "understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green\r\n",
      "and gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of\r\n",
      "many fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat--he had placed\r\n",
      "his overcoat on a chair--Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and\r\n",
      "several skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing\r\n",
      "at each of the others, ready for any emergency; though, indeed, my plans\r\n",
      "were somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For\r\n",
      "half an hour Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one\r\n",
      "tool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy\r\n",
      "of the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door\r\n",
      "swung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets,\r\n",
      "each tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was hard\r\n",
      "to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark lantern,\r\n",
      "for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to switch on\r\n",
      "the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently, and then\r\n",
      "in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked up his\r\n",
      "coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the window\r\n",
      "curtain, motioning me to do the same.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed\r\n",
      "his quicker senses. There was a noise somewhere within the house. A door\r\n",
      "slammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into\r\n",
      "the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in\r\n",
      "the passage outside the room. They paused at the door. The door opened.\r\n",
      "There was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. The door\r\n",
      "closed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne\r\n",
      "to our nostrils. Then the footsteps continued backwards and forwards,\r\n",
      "backwards and forwards, within a few yards of us. Finally, there was a\r\n",
      "creak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a\r\n",
      "lock and I heard the rustle of papers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division\r\n",
      "of the curtains in front of me and peeped through. From the pressure\r\n",
      "of Holmes’s shoulder against mine I knew that he was sharing my\r\n",
      "observations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the\r\n",
      "broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely\r\n",
      "miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom,\r\n",
      "but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the\r\n",
      "farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His\r\n",
      "broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the\r\n",
      "immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red\r\n",
      "leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long black cigar projecting\r\n",
      "at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket,\r\n",
      "claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long\r\n",
      "legal document, which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing\r\n",
      "rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise\r\n",
      "of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable\r\n",
      "attitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt Holmes’s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as\r\n",
      "if to say that the situation was within his powers and that he was\r\n",
      "easy in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too\r\n",
      "obvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly\r\n",
      "closed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In my own\r\n",
      "mind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his\r\n",
      "gaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my\r\n",
      "great-coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. But\r\n",
      "Milverton never looked up. He was languidly interested by the papers in\r\n",
      "his hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of\r\n",
      "the lawyer. At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and\r\n",
      "the cigar he will go to his room; but before he had reached the end of\r\n",
      "either there came a remarkable development which turned our thoughts\r\n",
      "into quite another channel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and\r\n",
      "once he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The\r\n",
      "idea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an\r\n",
      "hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from\r\n",
      "the veranda outside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his\r\n",
      "chair. The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the\r\n",
      "door. Milverton rose and opened it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said he, curtly, “you are nearly half an hour late.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal\r\n",
      "vigil of Milverton. There was the gentle rustle of a woman’s dress. I\r\n",
      "had closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton’s face had turned\r\n",
      "in our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once\r\n",
      "more. He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent\r\n",
      "angle from the corner of his mouth. In front of him, in the full glare\r\n",
      "of the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over\r\n",
      "her face, a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came quick and fast,\r\n",
      "and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Milverton, “you’ve made me lose a good night’s rest,\r\n",
      "my dear. I hope you’ll prove worth it. You couldn’t come any other\r\n",
      "time--eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if you couldn’t you couldn’t. If the Countess is a hard mistress\r\n",
      "you have your chance to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are\r\n",
      "you shivering about? That’s right! Pull yourself together! Now, let us\r\n",
      "get down to business.” He took a note from the drawer of his desk. “You\r\n",
      "say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess d’Albert.\r\n",
      "You want to sell them. I want to buy them. So far so good. It only\r\n",
      "remains to fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of course.\r\n",
      "If they are really good specimens--Great heavens, is it you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the mantle\r\n",
      "from her chin. It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted\r\n",
      "Milverton, a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading\r\n",
      "hard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a\r\n",
      "dangerous smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is I,” she said; “the woman whose life you have ruined.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Milverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. “You were so very\r\n",
      "obstinate,” said he. “Why did you drive me to such extremities? I\r\n",
      "assure you I wouldn’t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his\r\n",
      "business, and what was I to do? I put the price well within your means.\r\n",
      "You would not pay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you sent the letters to my husband, and he--the noblest gentleman\r\n",
      "that ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace--he broke\r\n",
      "his gallant heart and died. You remember that last night when I came\r\n",
      "through that door I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed in\r\n",
      "my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot\r\n",
      "keep your lips from twitching? Yes, you never thought to see me here\r\n",
      "again, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face\r\n",
      "to face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t imagine that you can bully me,” said he, rising to his feet. “I\r\n",
      "have only to raise my voice, and I could call my servants and have you\r\n",
      "arrested. But I will make allowance for your natural anger. Leave the\r\n",
      "room at once as you came, and I will say no more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly\r\n",
      "smile on her thin lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will ruin no more lives as you ruined mine. You will wring no more\r\n",
      "hearts as you wrung mine. I will free the world of a poisonous thing.\r\n",
      "Take that, you hound, and that!--and that!--and that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had drawn a little, gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after\r\n",
      "barrel into Milverton’s body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt\r\n",
      "front. He shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, coughing\r\n",
      "furiously and clawing among the papers. Then he staggered to his feet,\r\n",
      "received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. “You’ve done me,” he\r\n",
      "cried, and lay still. The woman looked at him intently and ground her\r\n",
      "heel into his upturned face. She looked again, but there was no sound\r\n",
      "or movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated\r\n",
      "room, and the avenger was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate;\r\n",
      "but as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton’s shrinking\r\n",
      "body I was about to spring out, when I felt Holmes’s cold, strong grasp\r\n",
      "upon my wrist. I understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining\r\n",
      "grip--that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a\r\n",
      "villain; that we had our own duties and our own objects which were not\r\n",
      "to be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when\r\n",
      "Holmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. He turned\r\n",
      "the key in the lock. At the same instant we heard voices in the house\r\n",
      "and the sound of hurrying feet. The revolver shots had roused the\r\n",
      "household. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe,\r\n",
      "filled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into\r\n",
      "the fire. Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. Someone\r\n",
      "turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. Holmes looked\r\n",
      "swiftly round. The letter which had been the messenger of death for\r\n",
      "Milverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. Holmes tossed\r\n",
      "it in among the blazing papers. Then he drew the key from the outer\r\n",
      "door, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. “This way,\r\n",
      "Watson,” said he; “we can scale the garden wall in this direction.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly.\r\n",
      "Looking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. The front door\r\n",
      "was open, and figures were rushing down the drive. The whole garden was\r\n",
      "alive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged\r\n",
      "from the veranda and followed hard at our heels. Holmes seemed to know\r\n",
      "the ground perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation\r\n",
      "of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost pursuer panting\r\n",
      "behind us. It was a six-foot wall which barred our path, but he sprang\r\n",
      "to the top and over. As I did the same I felt the hand of the man behind\r\n",
      "me grab at my ankle; but I kicked myself free and scrambled over a\r\n",
      "glass-strewn coping. I fell upon my face among some bushes; but Holmes\r\n",
      "had me on my feet in an instant, and together we dashed away across the\r\n",
      "huge expanse of Hampstead Heath. We had run two miles, I suppose, before\r\n",
      "Holmes at last halted and listened intently. All was absolute silence\r\n",
      "behind us. We had shaken off our pursuers and were safe.\r\n",

      " Colossians 1 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, 2 To God’s holy people in Colossae, the faithful brothers and sisters[a] in Christ:Grace and peace to you from God our Father.[b] Thanksgiving and Prayer3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 4 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all God’s people— 5 the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel 6 that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world—just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God’s grace. 7 You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant,[c] who is a faithful minister of Christ on our[d] behalf, 8 and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. 9 For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives,[e] 10 so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, 11 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, 12 and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you[f] to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. 13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. The Supremacy of the Son of God15 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. 16 For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him. 17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. 18 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. 19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, 20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. 21 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of[g] your evil behavior. 22 But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation— 23 if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. Paul’s Labor for the Church24 Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. 25 I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness— 26 the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord’s people. 27 To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 28 He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. 29 To this end I strenuously contend with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me. \n",

      "\n",
      " Colossians 2 2 I want you to know how hard I am contending for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally. 2 My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, 3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 4 I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments. 5 For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in Christ is. Spiritual Fullness in Christ6 So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, 7 rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. 8 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces[a] of this world rather than on Christ. 9 For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, 10 and in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority. 11 In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh[b] was put off when you were circumcised by[c] Christ, 12 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead. 13 When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you[d] alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, 14 having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross. 15 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.[e] Freedom From Human Rules16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. 17 These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. 18 Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you. Such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen; they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind. 19 They have lost connection with the head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. 20 Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its rules: 21 “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”? 22 These rules, which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use, are based on merely human commands and teachings. 23 Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence. \n",

      " Colossians 3 Living as Those Made Alive in Christ3 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is your[a] life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. 5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.[b] 7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 8 But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 11 Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all. 12 Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 13 Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. 15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 16 Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. Instructions for Christian Households18 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them. 20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. 21 Fathers,[c] do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged. 22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. 23 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 24 since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 25 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism. \n",

Further Instructions2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. 3 And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. 4 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. 5 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 6 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. Final Greetings7 Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant[a] in the Lord. 8 I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our[b] circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts. 9 He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here. 10 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.) 11 Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews[c] among my co-workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me. 12 Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured. 13 I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis. 14 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings. 15 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. 16 After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea. 17 Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.” 18 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. \n",
