lasso.R
	- Lasso regression model using caret for preprocessing and running the cross validation
	- Also a redundant cross validation method with out caret and another model training just to predict the coefficients
	- Before the running of the models there is some necessary data cleaning
	- I'm not sure how to convert the standardized predictions back to their proper form.

rf.R
	- random forest model that isn't completely working
