kaggle_geomean.py

	Computes the weighted geometric average ((x1*x2*x3...*xn)/n) of the two column kaggle submissions. Unfortunately it's hard to control
	the order of the globbing. That is the regex pulling in of all the local csv's. Run the script once with test weights and it will print
	out the order of processing. Use that print out to determine the order of the weights. 

	Run as such:
	python(2.7) kaggle_geomean.py '*.csv' 'ensembled/geomean_submission.csv' '1,2,3...'

	python2_executable script_name.py glob_csv outputfile comma_separated_list_of_weights



kaggle_avg.py

	Computes the weighted regular average

	Run as such:
	python(2.7) weighted kaggle_avgmean.py '*.csv' 'ensembled/mean_submission.csv'
